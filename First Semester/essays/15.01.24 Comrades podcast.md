_For this assignment, you will need to create a 15-minute podcast examining Marx's ideas in the _Communist Manifesto and talking about their wide-ranging impact. 
You should put near the beginning of your podcast some discussion on aspects of Marx’s ideas of what a Communist revolution is and make specific reference to ideas in the Communist Manifesto. 
You should then talk about examples where Marx’s revolutionary ideas have been impactful, for example by focusing on examples of the history of communism explored on the module and also think about its legacy today.
You should think about your audience as being interested in this topic, but not necessarily very knowledgeable, so you will need to explain things to them in an accessible way. You can also be creative and ‘brand’ your podcast for a specific audience but do make this clear in the podcast. It is important you explain things clearly and use examples well to make your points. 
You should upload a full bibliography as well as an audio recording of your podcast and you should reference key historians in the podcast by saying their names. You should use at least 8 – 10 secondary sources and there is a dedicated section on the reading list for the _Communist Manifesto.
To help ensure you will be able to develop your podcast, there will be guidance in classes and there is an online workshop and drop-in to help you in January, see NILE for more details._

# Chinese Revolution
## Singer, Peter, Marx : A Very Short Introduction , Revised Edition (Oxford : Oxford University Press, 2000), Very short introductions
- _Marx had now developed two important new insights: that economics is the chief form of human alienation, and that the material force needed to liberate humanity from its domination by economics is to be found in the working class._ [pg 32]
	- make note of the importance of this being a bottom up approach



## Marx, Karl, Friedrich Engels, and C. J. (Christopher John) Arthur, _The German Ideology. Part One_ (London: Electric Book Co., 2001)
_"Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established, an ideal to which reality [will] have to adjust itself"_ [pg 82]


## Cheng, E. and Hu, L., 2010. Sixty Years of Studies on Marxist Theory in China. 马克思主义研究, (01). [_HARVARD please change_]

- _The years from 1949 to 1965 were the initial period for laying the foundation for Marxist theoretical studies._ [pg.2]
- _popularizing Marxism, translation and publication of the Marxist classics were promoted in an all-round way, and certain progress was made in the studies on the fundamental tenets and principal works of Marxism. At the same time, research and educational institutions for Marxist theory were set up one after another, the contingent of personnel engaged in Marxist theoretical studies grew year by year, and the establishment of a system of different branches of Marxist learning was started._ [pg.2]
- _The Bureau of the Central Committee of the CPC for the Translation of the Works of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin was established in January 1953, and began to translate, edit and publish the works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Volume I of the Chinese edition of the Complete Works of Joseph Stalin came off the press at the end of 1953_ [pg.2]

## Marx, Karl, The Cambridge Companion to The Communist Manifesto / [Electronic Resource], ed. by Terrell Carver and James Farr (Cambridge : Cambridge University Press, 2015)
- _as exploitative, oppressive and brutal on a global scale_ [81]
	- showing that because of capitalist global nature required a global revolution 



## Gao, Zhipeng, ‘From Empirical Observation to Social Intervention: The Marxization of Psychology in China, 1949–1958’, _Review of General Psychology_, 24.1 (2020), 43–59

- _First, the radical intellectuals accused ahistorical empirical observation of failing to recognize that the Chinese mental capacity, so far impaired by class domination, could display tremendous growth in socialism._ [43]


## Ishikawa, Yoshihiro, and Martin N Hinze, _The Formation of the Chinese Communist Party_, trans. by Joshua A. Fogel, 1st ed. (New York: Columbia University Press, 2013)

- _This year a huge number of magazines have been discussing socialism. Some have been short-lived, but there is a strong sense that if they do not discuss socialism at all, they cannot be considered publications of the New Culture Movement_ [pg 16]
- _The Marxism that spread through the major cities of China gained the strong support of Soviet Russia and the Comintern, culminating in the formation of the Chinese Communist Party._ [pg 16]
- this revolution became a sort of __knowledge Revolution__ as it appeared as an all inclusive ideology
- this new culture movement painted the picture of traditional chinese thought as _cannibalistic confucianism_ womens liberation, a scientific view of the world literary revolution and comparison of eastern and western civilisations and industrial promotion [chapter 1 the reception of marxism in china]
- There is the argument in Ishikawa's book that Marxism was first something acquired by reading books and required thorough study of its own which is less of a bottom up approach however i would argue that the bottom up approach of the communist manifesto relates mostly to who is going to be the driving force in the revolution not necessarily the initial spread of Marxism


# Russian Revolution

## Fitzpatrick, Sheila, _Russian Revolution._, 3rd ed. (Oxford University Press, 2008)
- _The three decades before the 1917 Revolution saw not impoverishment but an increase in national wealth; and it was in this period that Russia experienced its ﬁrst spurt of economic growth as a result of the government’s industrialization policies, foreign investment, modernization of the banking and credit structure, and a modest development of native entrepreneurial activity. The peasantry, which still constituted 80 per cent of Russia’s population at the time of the Revolution, had not experienced a marked improvement in its economic position._ [pg 15]

## Starodubrovskaia, Irina, and Vladimir Mau, ‘Marx’s Theory of Revolution and the Revolutions of the Twentieth Century’, in _The Challenge of Revolution_ (United Kingdom: Oxford University Press, 2001)

- _the origins of the crisis which led to the recent Russian revolution can be explained perfectly well in terms of Marxist theory._ [pg299]
- _Less attention has been paid to another of the preconditions for revolution, the consequences of the development of productive forces which, as Marx put it, at a certain stage 'come into conflict with the existing relations of production', necessitating a revolutionary change in the social structure._ [pg300]
- __The three decades before the 1917 Revolution saw not impoverishment but an increase in national wealth; and it was in this period that Russia experienced its ﬁrst spurt of economic growth as a result of the government’s industrialization policies, foreign investment, modernization of the banking and credit structure, and a modest development of native entrepreneurial activity. The peasantry, which still constituted 80 per cent of Russia’s population at the time of the Revolution, had not experienced a marked improvement in its economic position.__ [pg 15 of sheila fitzpatrick russian revolution]
