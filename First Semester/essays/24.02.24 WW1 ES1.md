## Horne, John, _A Companion to World War I_ (Chichester: Wiley-Blackwell, 2012)
- _World War I is often depicted as a war of machines in which technology and science played a pivotal role and humans were turned into helpless, impotent puppets_ [pg 307]
- _technical environment, which included tanks, planes, submarines, high explosives, and gas, was very different to that which had existed at the outset_ [pg 307]
- _New armaments had a major effect on operational practices on the battlefield: artillery killed at long range,_ [307] 
	- long range effect means new tactics develop
- _Better communication systems meant that for the first time commanders could operate at a considerable distance from their soldiers – and this was even truer of naval communications._ [307]
- _The Allies, for example, believed that since the late nineteenth century they had fallen behind in the scientific field, especially chemistry, while Germany had developed the capacity to industrially organize its scientific output._ [308]
	- maybe argue this as a reason that technology wasn't as important as maybe believed because Germans were arguably ahead in industrialisation 
- _As Lloyd George concluded, it was basically an “engineer’s war.”_ [308] 
	- link this to heavy use of tanks and increase of air craft 
- _perceived in the popular imagination as a “chemists’ war,”_ [308]
- _Overall, however, the strategic effects of gas warfare were minimal. In military terms, the use of toxic gases as a weapon did not produce the decisive breakthrough and a return to mobile combat that would end the deadlock of the trenches._ [308]

- _London had experienced raids since May 1915 but this was different in being in broad daylight, and by aircraft. Previous raids had been by Zeppelin airships, the threat of which had been largely neutralised by improving air defences and by the technical deficiencies of the Zeppelins themselves._ [163]

- _Motor vehicles were replacing horses, machine guns were being mass-produced, and artillery could reach farther with ever increasing accuracy._ [30]
- _Unlike the Boer War, combat in Europe saw soldiers facing each other from deep trenches that scarred the landscape of France and Belgium. The new methods of warfare called for new solutions_ [32]
- _The Central Powers started the technology race by building thousands of rapid-firing machine guns and highly accurate artillery guns, and then developing poisonous gas._ [33]
- _Aviation developed, arguably, faster than any other field of technology in the First World War. First used for reconnaissance and surveillance, airplanes were quickly adapted to drop bombs on the enemy. By 1918, when the war ended, airplanes had been modified to do everything from aerial photography to providing air-to-ground support for infantry and tanks._ [33]
- _I n 1912 the British government, reversing its decision of 1909 that airplanes had no role in future warfare, authorized the establishment of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC)._ [33]
- _While the reconnaissance aircraft proved useful they, like French planes used in the same role, were hampered by not having an effective way to relay information quickly to the ground._ [34]
- _By spotting the enemy artillery and using their new wireless sets, the pilots could communicate with artillery crews and accurately direct shell fire, ultimately saving Allied lives._ [35]
- _Working together with aircraft designers, scientists also found ways to make the cameras smaller and more stable. Aircraft, combined with photography, gave war planners a view of the battlefield they had never had before._ [36]

- _Machine guns had evolved from crank-operated gadgets whose unreliability was commemorated in poetry to recoil-operated weapons whose precision-manufactured cartridges reduced jamming to a minimum - or at least to tactically acceptable level_ [75]
- _After 1871 railroads and steamships, telephones, telegraphs, cables, and finally wireless communication became integral to the war plans of the great powers_ [74]

- _They produced not only armoured cars for reconnaissance, heavy tanks for breakthrough and medium tanks for pursuit and exploitation, but bridging tanks, gun-carrying tanks (crude self-propelled guns) and a variant of the Mark V (the Mark V*) tank which was intended partly as an armoured personnel carrier._ [113]
- _helped maintain the momentum of attacks and sometimes precipitated the surrender of German troops._ [113]
- _Everyone now knows that armoured forces played a major part in preventing the entrenched stalemate experienced on the Western Front in 1914-18_ [114]

- _During World War I aviation evolved from an instrument of reconnaissance used singly in 1914 by tiny air arms into an arm with up to 300,000 men in service._ [159]
- _the opening period, soldiers spontaneously dug “foxholes” to protect themselves from shells. These individual holes were progressively linked together and became the basis for the first trench lines._[174]
- _The repeating rifle used by Western armies at the beginning of the twentieth century could fire over ten projectiles a minute in the form of fast, spinning, conical bullets across a target distance of around 600 m._ [174]

- _For close-quarter fighting in confined spaces, many experienced soldiers preferred to use improvised clubs, knives and knuckledusters rather than cumbersome rifles. These were also more suited to silent killing._
- _Tanks were developed by the British Army as a mechanical solution to the trench warfare stalemate. They were first used on the Somme in September 1916, where they were mechanically unreliable and too few in number to secure a victory._
- _One of the few ways in which tanks were effective during the war was their ability to break through barbed wire defences._
- _Artillery was the most destructive weapon on the Western Front. Guns could rain down high-explosive shells, shrapnel and poison gas on the enemy. Heavy fire could destroy troop concentrations, wire and fortified positions._
- _At the start of the war, the British bombarded the enemy before sending infantry over the top, but this tactic became less effective as the war progressed._
- _Before the Battle of the Somme  (1916), the Germans retreated into their concrete dugouts during the artillery barrage, emerging when they heard the guns stop_.
- _The army developed tactics like the creeping barrage, which saw troops advance across no-man's land behind the safety of a line of shell fire._
- _It was a relatively new weapon at the start of the war, but British and German forces soon realised its potential as a killing machine, especially when fired from a fixed defensive position._
- _The Vickers machine gun was famed for its reliability. It could fire over 600 rounds per minute and had a range of 4,500 yards._
- _With proper handling, it could sustain a rate of fire for hours. This was providing that a necessary supply of belted ammunition, spare barrels and cooling water was available._
- _The Lewis Gun (above) was the British Army’s most widely used machine gun. It required a team of two gunners to
  #'
   operate it, one to fire and one to carry ammunition and reload._
- _As gunnery practice improved, the British were able to use this light machine gun to give effective mobile support to their ground troops. The gun was so successful that it was later fitted to aircraft._
- _Initially, aircraft carried out artillery spotting and photographic reconnaissance. This work gradually led pilots into aerial battles against enemies engaged in similar activities._
- _As the war progressed, aircraft were fitted with machine guns and strafed enemy trenches and troop concentrations. As the speed and flying capabilities of aircraft improved, they started bombing airfields, transportation networks and industrial facilities._
- _The standard British rifle was the Short Magazine Lee Enfield (SMLE) Rifle Mk III. It had a maximum range of 2,280 metres, but an effective killing range of 550 metres._
- _A well-trained infantryman could fire 15 rounds a minute. In August 1914, the Germans mistook the speed and precision of the British rifle fire for machine guns._
- _A rifle fitted with a bayonet could prove unwieldy in a confined trench, so many soldiers preferred to use improvised trench clubs instead. However, the bayonet remained a versatile tool that was also used for cooking and eating!_
- _The stalemate was only overcome in [1918](https://www.nam.ac.uk/explore/1918-victory) after years spent learning new tactics that combined the effective use of these weapons_

- _Many of the characteristics of the modern style of warfare listed above are not in themselves modern: commanders have always understood the importance of time, knowledge of the enemy, superior firepower, and the role of decisive maneuver_ [134]
- _The model of 1917-18 seems scarcely dated eighty years later. But in 1914, a mere three years earlier, it would have been entirely unfamiliar_ [135]

_Out of the disaster of 1 July came the creeping barrage,_ [107]

_These were, for example, tanks, aircraft, mortars, machine-guns and the techniques associated with heavy artillery firing indirectly. But all of these were auxiliaries. None was a battle winner by itself. Each had had to be used in co-operation_ [82]
