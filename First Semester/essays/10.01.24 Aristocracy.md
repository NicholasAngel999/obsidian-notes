# war and its impact 
### Perkin, Harold James, _The Rise of Professional Society : England since 1880_, 2nd ed. (London ; Routledge, 2002)
- _The Great War came to be seen by those who looked back from the inter-war period to the lost world of Victorian and Edwardian England as a great divide between two quite different societies.  , that earlier society inhabited an Indian summer of gracious living, the whirl of the London ‘season’ and country house parties, an endless round of pleasure based on low taxes, cheap servants and the self-confidence which went with unquestioned status. At the opposite pole, the poor and their professional surveyors looked back on a world in which life for the great majority was one long struggle to survive_ {please make this shorter}  [pg 224]
- _the First World War has often been credited or blamed for a series of major social changes which, it has been countered, would probably have happened sooner or later anyway. Although it inaugurated very little, the war certainly accelerated most of the major trends which were already in operation in prewar England._ [page 225]
- income equality declined from 1867 for nearly a century however 1867 top 10% of earners earnt 50.6% of national income and in 1913 they still received 49.8% __not a direct quote__ [page 242]
- _‘Only since the First World War has there been a decrease, and this decrease is substantial.’ 52 This has been confirmed by the Diamond Commission on the Distribution of Income and Wealth of the 1970s, which found that the top 10 per cent of earners received 40.5 per cent of total personal income (before tax) in 1938 and 32.1 per cent in 1949_ [page 242]
- _‘the redistribution of wealth over this century has not been between the rich and the poor, but between successive generations of the same family.’_ [page 244]
- _‘The old order is doomed,’ wrote the Duke of Marlborough in 1919 when death duties were raised to 40 per cent, a rate he claimed was deliberately aimed at preventing the inheritance of great houses._ [pg 251]

- _After the war, an enormous transfer of land occurred throughout Europe as gentlemen farmers and great “feudal” families in Great Britain, France, Italy, Hungary, Austria, and Italy found it no longer profitable to maintain their country places._ [pg 151]
- _The aristocracy had seen the destruction of its wealth and savings as a result of the war._ [page 153]
- _Thus, all in all, and despite the human and material losses suffered by the aristocracy during the war and in the years immediately following it, Europe’s prewar social structure survived_ [page 153]

### Rothery, Mark, ‘The Wealth of the English Landed Gentry, 1870-1935’, Agricultural History Review, 55.2 (2007), 251–68
- _Thompson and David Cannadine amongst others have shown that the aristocracy and the gentry were willing to diversify their investments into mining, railways and a range of other urban and industrial ventures as economic conditions came to permit such behaviour_ [pg 251]
-  _The slow and gradual decline of landed elites along with their fluid relations with new aspirants to elite society helps explain, it has been argued, the smooth and evolutionary nature of modernisation in Britain. In particular, the gentry provided an important safety valve for any possible social tensions arising from industrialisation, urbanisation, démocratisation and the development of meritocracy_ [page 252] 
- _From a fresh perspective it will be shown that the gentry were, indeed, a highly adaptable social group during this period. By making use of probate records and by including the estates of the lesser gentry in possession of less than 2000 acres, this research supports the arguments of Thompson as opposed to those of Stone and Rubinstein_ [pg 253]

- _The question is whether the rest of the country followed the example set by the elite. In the first months of the war, the answer seems to have been in the affirmative._ [pg 452]

### Cannadine, David, _The Decline and Fall of the British Aristocracy_ (New Haven, Conn. ; Yale University Press, 1990)
- _But from the 1880s, all this changed. Few great houses were built, either in London or the country, and many were sold or demolished._ [pg 89]
- _During the first three-quarters of the nineteenth century, the British landed establishment had been the wealth élite of the richest nation in the world. But during the seventy years that followed, it was noticeably disturbed and diminished by new and international developments that it could not control_ [page 90]
- _As the world became smaller, more competitive, and more unified; as distances were shortened by the steamship, the wireless, the telegraph, and the aeroplane; and as the economic autonomy and self-sufficiency of nations was eroded and undermined, the landowners of Britain were exposed to the full and icy blast of the global economy. Their economic circumstances were much less determined by the state of the harvest in Barset or by the health of their bank account in London, than by the price of wheat in Chicago and by financial dealings on the New York stock exchange_ [pg 90]
- _By the 1930s, it was not uncommon for a local aristocrat to sit on the board of a London-based company, something quite rare fifty years earlier, but (to) have only marginal involvement in the affairs of his locality._ [pg 391]
- _Between the onset of the Great Depression and the outbreak of the Second World War, the traditional British territorial classes ceased to be the wealth elite, as new, rival, and gigantic non-landed fortunes proliferated; and they also ceased to be the landed elite, as the great estates were gradually broken up and dispersed._ [pg 391] 

### Rothery, Mark, ‘The Wealth of the English Landed Gentry, 1870-1935’, _Agricultural History Review_, 55.2 (2007), 251–68
- _The highly adaptable nature of landed elites in the face of profound changes in modern society and the flexibility of relations between landed and non-landed elites have been amongst the most important findings of scholars of landed society over the past fifty years._ [pg251]
- _Equally, the force of the attractive power of landownership, it has been argued, led the rising middle classes to their status through new forms of culture and politics_ [pg 251]

- _enfranchising the working classes, the 1867 Reform Act did nevertheless mark a sea-change in British political life. A substantial section of the urban working class was now enfranchised, and each party was keen to capture these new votes._ [pg 82]
		- more people could now vote and whilst seems like an increase in democracy and decrease in aristocratic political power


### Cragoe, Matthew, and Paul Readman, _The Land Question in Britain, 1750-1950_, 1st ed. 2010. (Basingstoke, England ; Palgrave Macmillan, 2010)
- _The potential Liberal reforms, of which only death duties were introduced, were on hold while the Conservatives were in power from 1895, but the Liberal landslide in the 1906 general election bought land reform ﬁrmly back onto the political agenda_ [pg 222]
- _What he proposed in 1909, in what came to be called the ‘People’s Budget’, was relatively modest – a tax on vacant land, ground rents and mining royalties, a Reversion Duty on the termination of a lease, a tax on capital gains, and an increase in estate duties._ [pg 223] 
- _Coming as they did on top of the years of agricultural difﬁculty and the growing impact of death duties – as more and more families experienced them at ﬁrst hand – these proposals appeared to the landed classes in a rather different light and helped to provoke the constitutional crisis of 1909– 11, which magniﬁed their real signiﬁcance._ [pg 223]
