Bujak, Edward, _English Landed `society in the Great War: Defending the Realm,_ (London: Bloomsbury Academic, 2019)

1)     What role did the aristocracy play in Britain’s First World War effort?

v ‘The Edwardian officer corps was ‘drawn largely from traditional elites, and rank reflected close correlation with the land’ ’ (p2)

v Lloyd George wanted to give veterans of the war a place to live on the land to make England ‘a land fit for heroes’ (p3) [land that the aristocracy owned, and would provide for this moral and farming effort)

v Aristocrats such as Lord Farrer were seen as trying to protect the ‘beauty spots’ of England and thus carried the view that in ‘defence of the realm’, should consider its preservation in the ‘aesthetic frame’ (p7)

v ‘By tradition, by training, and by temperament, the aristocracy was a warrior class (p8)

v ‘English landed society was woefully unprepared for the scale of the war’ (p8)

v Aristocrats had to give up large aspects of their power in order to continue to fight in France (p12)

v Aristocrats were made to give up their houses as hospitals. This act was described as an act of ‘patriotism’ even though the aristocrats tried to fight against it (p95)

v The Earl of Harewood offered to set aside part of Harewood House as an auxiliary hospital In Jan 1915 (pp95-96)

v The ‘ladies of the house’ put themselves to work in their auxiliary hospitals (p96)

v Lord Clinton culled part of his herd of deer to provide food for the wounded soldiers on his estate (p97)

v Aristocrats had to give up their parks and let the sheep ‘graze on [their] velvet lawns’ (p97)

v The Corn Production Act ‘guaranteed process for farmers’ but prevented the rising of rents (102)

v At Belton Park, the temporary tents set up for the army there began to be accompanied by ‘corrugated iron huts’ as the temporary camp became more permanent (p104)

2) **What impact did the First World War have on the status, moral, and lifestyle of the aristocracy

v In 1909, Lloyd George critiqued how the aristocracy indulged in the grandeur of land ownership without a second thought for those around them. But in 1918 he praised them for the ‘sacrifice’ they made (p10)

v In 1917, the power the aristocrats had over farming and thus food was effectively nullified as the Board of Agriculture set up smaller County Agricultural Executive Committees. They worked with the Food Production Department and together effectively removed any real power the aristocrats had over their farmers (p11) 

v Aristocrats were made to give up their houses as hospitals. This act was described as an act of ‘patriotism’ even though the aristocrats tried to fight against it (p95)

v Aristocrats in the HoL tried and failed to amend Subsection 1 Paragraph D of the Defense of the Realm Act. It allowed for government to take over entire aristocratic lands including the main house if deemed necccisarry for the war effort. The HoL tried to limit it to the lands (p95) and tried to make it practically impossible to work by having it brought to both the HoC and HoL, where the HoL could just tie it up.

v During the war, keeping herds of deer and game birds was a ‘luxury that landowners could no longer indulge’ (p98)

v Despite not being able to keep herds of deer of the most part, some aristocrats were able to hold on. For example, one West Suffolk landowner was able to keep his head gamekeeper out of the war so long as he remained in the position and continued to supply food through the herd, hallowing the deer herd to continue on the property (pp98-99)

v Traditional landowners believed by 1917 that Lloyd George wanted to ‘reduce their position to that of mere rent receivers’ (p101)

v Landowners believed that they were serving the country properly by giving up parts of their estates to the war effort (p104)

Cannadine, D, _The Decline and Fall of the British Aristocracy,_ (New York: Vintage Books, 1999)

3) What signals does Canadine consider to display the ‘End of the Affair’

v Finances/Taxation

Ø  Taxation and austerity meant that the Country Houses, Townhouses, and non-agricultural goods such as works of art were destroyed and or placed on the market to sell (p638)

Ø  The 1950s and 1960s gave only a brief pause to the threat of large property as land values rose, but rising taxes and costs in the 70s meant that the Aristocracy ‘ceased to be an economically definable class’ (p638)

Ø  The price of farmland remains relatively the same in 1950 as it had in 1880 despite prices rising for everything else (p640)

In 1948 Death Duties became 75% for anyone with over £1 million in property (e.g, Inland Revenue had to set up a whole department to assess to vast wealth of the Second Duke of Westminster in 1953) (p640)

Ø  The sale and destruction of country houses was larger than that of townhouses due to their immense size making them uneconomical  p643)

Ø  The ‘Indian Summer’ of the 50s and 60s came to an abrupt end in the 70s. As taxation rose alongside worldwide inflation, aristocrats felt the pinch once again (p652)

Ø  The aftermath of the Indian Summer saw aristocrats with land they couldn’t sell, demolish, or maintain (p652)

Ø  The proceeds of tourism through aristocratic houses couldn’t keep up with maintenace costs, even including tax cuts provided by the tourists (p653)

Ø   

v Political power

Ø  Landowners only really ‘lingered on’ in the periphery of Britain and the empire, such as in Northern Ireland, Kenya, and [Zimbabwe] Rhodesia’ (p638)

Ø  After being made Lord Lieutenant, the Earl Peel attempted to expand Hyning Hall to make it fit for his new position. However, he failed to gain a license to do so, was prosecuted, and then forced to resign (p640)

Ø  By 1956 only 1/3 of the peerage still possessed country estates (p642)

Ø  In 1949 the Labour government were able to pass a bill that further decreased the power of the House of Lords in respective to the House of Commons (p663)

Ø  Between 1955-60, only 8 of the non-royal Dukes spoke in the HoL, and most of the time none of their speeches were about the great problems of the time (p668)

Ø  In the post-war administration and government, the old elite were seldom in power (p669)

Ø  In 1950, England, ‘only 3 of the 49 county councils were chaired by peers’ (p671)

Ø  ‘In the Britian of the 1990s

Ø  Many of the old families whose names demanded ‘automatic succession’ to titles such as Lord and appointment to important positions (at least culturally) no longer existed, such as Argyll, Derby and Sutherland (p684)-

v Environmental factors:

Ø  The harsh winter of 1947 practically made great houses ‘unlivable’ (p640)

v Issues with land:

Ø  The price of farmland remains relatively the same in 1950 as it had in 1880 despite prices rising for everything else (p640)

Ø  By 1956 only 1/3 of the peerage still possessed country estates (p642)

Ø  In 1946, the government also began accepting land in lieu of Death Duty payments, and this was soon expanded to works of art and historic buildings. Between 1947-1957, the Treasury passed on 26 aristocratic properties to the National Trust, including some of the most famous aristocratic homes, such as Hardwick Hall (645)

Ø  In the 50s and 60s fortunes looked up as farmland began to rise in price, to £114 per acre between 1963-4 (p650)

v Loss of great houses

Ø  The townhouses that survived the Blitz were largely sold off as office space after the Second World War (p643)

Ø  The sale and destruction of country houses was larger than that of townhouses due to their immense size making them uneconomical (p643)

Ø  Between 1945-1955, 400 country houses were demolished (p644)

Ø  Between 1880-1976, the surviving estates were highly diminished. By 76% in England and Wales, and 69% in Scotland (p649)

v Other issues:

Ø  There were clear trends of decline after the Second World War that were ‘an intensification’ of the trends of the First World War (p642)

Ø  Jobs deemed suitable for aristocrats widened out of pure necessity. For example, the heir to the Duke of Argyll studied electronics at university in Canada before working for the Wall Street brokerage firm ‘Rank Xerox’. The Lords Harewood and Drogheda became involved in the opera’ (p649)

v The start of conservation:

Ø  The Attlee Labour government was concerned about the destruction of Country Houses, not due to them having being the ‘derelict machines in which the upper classes had once lived’, but due to the idea of ‘national heritage’ (p645)

Ø  In 1948, the Gowers Committee was set up to see what could be done with old country houses that were beginning to be demolished (p645)

Ø  The Growers Committee’s major assessment was the setting up of ‘Historic Buildings Councils’ for England, Scotland, and Wales which would offer government loans for renovation in return for public access to the houses (p465)

Ø  In 1946, the government also began accepting land in lieu of Death Duty payments, and this was soon expanded to works of art and historic buildings. Between 1947-1957, the Treasury passed on 26 aristocratic properties to the National Trust, including some of the most famous aristocratic homes, such as Hardwick Hall (645)

Ø  Determined not to lose Woburn Abby to the National Trust, the Duke opened it up to the public in 1955, receiving 180,000 visitors a year (p647)

Ø  The aftermath of the Indian Summer saw aristocrats with land they couldn’t sell, demolish, or maintain (p652)

Ø  In 1980, the National Heritage Mumorial Fund was established to help fund heritage projects, though most of its fund has been used to keep country houses alive (p563)

v Are they really gone?

Ø  As of 1999, Britain's richest man, and Britain's largest land owner are still both Dukes (p660)

Ø  By 1981, only 11 peers had disclaimed there titles, and of those peers some had done so to make attempts at high-ranking positions in the Commons, such as Home and Hailsham when they vied for the Tory leadership in 1963 (p681)

4) What place do the sales of land and estates play in Canadine's perspective?:

They are the main and primary reason for the loss of aristocratic power and prestige. Due to political and economic issues regarding such things as tax (e.g., Death Duties) and the loss of political control such large houses and estates were no longer viable, and their ailing state became a physical representation of the health of the old aristocratic elite. The intervention of the government through such groups as the National Trust effectively placed country houses on life support and thus allowed for the continuation of aristocrats in an equally dimished form. Once the 1948 change from country hosues being the homes of the elites to them being symbols of natioanl heritage occured any sembelance of those houses also being power bases went too.
