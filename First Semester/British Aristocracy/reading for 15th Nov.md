much of the 20th century it was believed that the British country house had ’had its day’ and that it would slowly 'wither away’. However, in the late 20th century the reverse is true (p423) 
By the late 80s early 90s the ’almost weekly’ tearing down of country houses had all but ended (p424) 
The Town and Country Planning Act of 1968 prevented the demolition of listed buildings in without permission, which included country houses (p424) 
In the late 80s/ early 90s period they 'probably looked better....than they had been for at least a century’ (p424) 
‘Houses on the scale of Arundel Castle...were once again becoming family homes (P224) [not sure how you can call a castle a ‘family home’ but sure] 
‘Duncombe Park in Yorkshire was once again the seat of Lord Feversham, after more than sixty years as a girls’ preparatory school’ (p224) [nice...great rid of the school for a house] 
Thatcherism has allowed for the richest in society to have more disposable wealth to pour into [obnoxiously] large houses (p224) 
A resurgence in the price of neo-classical statues and paintings has created a vast array of wealth for aristocrats to fall back on as a survival strategy to raise funds (pp225-225) 
Country houses didn't go through ’crisis’ but rather ‘unexpected challenges’ (p225) 
New generations see a future in the country house which has allowed them to keep going. They see owning one as a 'burden and responsibility’ (pp225-226) 
He argues that it was not death duties or the First World War that killed the country house but politics (p226) [what the fuck are death duties if not politics genius]  
Those who ruled the country had to live in country houses (until 1914). This was true to the extent that suppers of Benjamin Disraeli brought him Hughenden Manor (p427) 
To this day the PM has a country house, as Lord/Sir Aruther Lee left the office of the PM Chequers as a ’gift’ in 1917 (p227) 
The rise of stuff like human rights and democracy [boo-hoo] meant that the aristocracy had been stripped of their power before WWI (p227) [he quite fortunately forgets about women's rights to vote in 1918 and everything else but shhhhh we don't talk about that]  
Whilst prestige was attached to land ache-rage there was a reason for aristocrats to keep a tight grip on land, even if it wasn't making them money. However, the agricultural depression and the rising wages and demands of farmers meant that the reality of holding onto that land prestige was becoming harder and harder to maintain (p227) 
[He goes on a longass rant about the' Country Life’ magazine, and how talking about country houses as massive estates that were passed down generation to genoration as the main seat of the family is a poor measure of a country house between pages 227-234] 
Suburban villas became popular for aristocrats as an alternative to living in a country house. The appeal was proximity to powerful cities, particularly London. As time went on and transport became better they could go further out, and with better railway connections villas could be scattered across the country (p234) 
The country house is no longer a ‘powerhouse’ but it still preforms many of its other roles. Many of them provide economic and cultural bonuses for local areas, many of the more scenic areas of Britian lay on country house land. (P234) 
Country houses also provide both a boasting ability to show off wealth and the ability to hide wealth, as many, such as the Duke and Dutchess of Devonshire at Chatsworth bemoan the cost of keeping up the property and all the expenses, making them less of a target for public anger. (p234)
