## reading 
- Inter-war writers of crime fiction such as Agatha Christie, credited with ushering in the ’golden age of detective fiction’, prominently featured Aristocrats as primary characters (pp772-773) 
- Middle class readers lurched few books between 1900-1949 due to their price, with most getting their books though subscriptions (pp773-774) 
- Agatha Christie was in the top 10 of books sold at the time though the subscription libraries (p774) 
- These interwar books have been argued to be either a return to traditional values or a way of therapy from WWI, with the books often showing a per-industrialized word of harmonious aristocratic rule (p775) 
- Argues that they were not merely reactionary and conservative, but rather that they were suggesting the recreation of the old ordered aristocratic world with the addition of the middle classes and consumerism (p775) [however, that can in itself be argued to be a conservative reaction to the growth of the middle class and consumerism, and particularly a British conservative reaction, recalling Edmund Burk’s ‘change to conserve’. This, therefore, can be seen as popular fiction changing the aristocracy to conserve their position in the new society that was being constructed in the wake of WWI]  
- Important to note that ’Britain emerged from the First World War with its monarch and aristocracy intact’ (p776) 
- The end of the war saw the old ideas of class crumble away to new ones with consumerist twists. The idea of defining oneself by social standing and ‘breeding’ was removed for how one could show off though their materialistic purchases- appearing, rather than the celebrity of birth, became important in distinguishing class affiliations and thus allowed for a more mobile social ladder (p777) 
- Part of this reorganisation of the aristocracy for the interwar period was refashioning the aristocrat as useful not because of their ’disinterested’ amiturism, but rather because they did somthing and acted in the best interest by brining their special skills as aristocrats  (p777)  
- There were marriages between the upper-class and upper middle-class peoples during the interwar years reflected in the books written (p782) 
- In the Sayer’s book ’Murder Must Advertise, she has her main aristocrat detective Whimsy to uphold the ’gentlmans code’ by allowing the main antagonist to be killed rather than subjugate his family to the humiliation of a murder trial. The books 'refashions nobility’ by employing the idea of new sort of 1933 gentleman (p787) 
- Marsh’s novel ‘Death in a White Tie’, is set in the London Season, [the time honoured aristocrat tradition], where Marsh investigates the idea of aristocracy as an increasingly rotten institution, with some of the suspected motives being things such as threat of disinheritance. When the character ‘Withers’ refuses to tell the inspector who he was with at the time of the murder, the inspector chastises him for being a gentleman who out to know better (pp787-788)
