- The ‘influence, prestige, and wealth of the Aristocracy continued long after 1832’ (p67) 
- Between 1830 and 1914, there were 50 great townhouses in major areas of London, with roughly 12 of them being newly constructed. However, the two major ‘palatial’ townhouses constructed during this time belonged to ‘new men’ and not a traditional landed family (p67) 
- The last private mansion to be built in London was Aberconway House, built by the Liberal MP Sir Charles McLaren between 1920-22. Whilst now this seems like a terrible time to be building such a house due to many being sold off and torn down, many at the time simply assumed the old order of things would resume itself given time after WWI (p68) 
	- ‘the Great War was a real disaster, 1832 pretended to be one...by the mid 1830s the Season was back on course’ (p68) 
- Just under half of Edwardian and Victorian townhouses saw external renovations during their respective periods, and almost all Victorian houses had internal alterations too (p68) 
- The interior of Stafford or Lancaster House cost £270,00 (£10 million today) to create and opened in 1835, three years after the Reform Bill, and once it was called the ‘Versailles of London’ by contemporaries (p69) 
- The Percy family kept Northumberland House, an extremely large building, up to date all throughout the 1860s (p69) 
- Even in the early 20th century Townhouses were being modernized and refurbished by aristocrats. In 1900 Bath House in Piccadilly was revamped, in 1907 Stratford House had a ballroom added, and in 1908 Bourdon House was enlarged and gained five new bedroom wings in1909 (p69) 
- Importantly, the Russels family didn’t see the need to replace their townhouse with any equivalent despite being one of the richest aristocratic dynasties in England (p70) 
- Cambridge House was purchased in 1850 by Palmerston, who used it as his ‘political nerve center’ until his death (p70) 
- Northumberland House had given the Duke of Northumberland a boost in his societal standing due to its size and position in London. However, he didn’t much seem disturbed if he lost it, due to his country retreate of Syon House being made accessible to London, now only 20 minuets away from Waterloo (1880s) (p71) 
- Of the 30 wealthiest landowners in the 1880s all of them excluding one had Townhouses in London (and all but one of them were old family aristocrats, the other being a banker) (p71) 
	- Despite the 30 wealthiest owning townhouses, less than 5% of the below 30 owned a named townhouse after the 1880s (pp71-72) 
	- Despite who owned townhouses ownership didn’t correlate to great wealth by the standards of aristocrats. And those with great status also didn’t necessarily own great townhouses either (p73) 
- Townhouses with their ballrooms served the ability to ‘screen’ new men entering the aristocratic elite and allowed for the old families to deem their suitability (p73) 
- Townhouses could elevate the position of people in a similar way to a country house in the societal scene. Before Duchess Luoise of Manchester received her titles she only owned an ‘average town house’, yet was the ‘queen of society’ between the 1850s and 1860s. (p72) 
- If a political career was in the interest of an aristocrat it was ‘highly valuable’ to own a townhouse (p72) 
- The last great political saloon hosted at a townhouse was in the 1850’s and 1860’s at Cambridge House, where the hostess Lady Palmerston was seen as highly influence in keeping her husband in office (p74) 
- Between 1880-1914, however, the role of the townhouse as a political body began to weigh as Gladstone had created an overwhelming Conservative majority in the HoL, meaning less of a need to levy political favour. During the same period agricultural prices meant that the aristocrats saw increasing pressure to emonomise their landed interests (pp74-75) 
- One response of the aristocracy was to rent their townhouses to notables and rich members of London society (p75) 
- Many aristocrats left townhouses for the country houses or land in the empire, but some remained in London and retrained control of the ‘marriage market’, testing the so-called suitability of American heiresses (p75) 
- By 1900 only one of London’s townhouses was occupied by a ‘true aristocrat’ (p76) [But this is likly due to the country house being the place where most ‘true aristocrats’ had their wealth and power.] 
- The ‘Great War... continued and magnified trends that were already underway’ (p76) 
- There were 30 great townhouses in 1914, 21 still owned by the aristcracy. But by 1940 only 8 were left (p76) 
- Upkeep was practically impossible in the later years of the First World War (p77) 


During the First World War the very consept of the marriage market [the thing that kept townhouses alive] crumbeled and was never recovered (p77)
