# re worded slides 

## slide who?
- the term aristocracy is not easy to define and actual functions best as a fluid term that can change and adapt to how it is being used. 
- The more we try to define aristocracy the more 'fuzzy' the term becomes (Dr Sarti, Royal Studies journal)
- Aristocracy originated as the people who ran government but evolved into a way to denote hereditary distinction that would echo down the history of Europe (Doyle, A Very Short Introduction)
- Then the more modern view of aristocracy is more focused on wealth which does carry its own sense of power but not the same as people of government status.
- I think it is best kept unclear and instead of trying to give a solid definition to aristocracy, allowing the definition to flow and fit its purpose and instead try to best understand how the aristocracy conducted themselves and the impact they had on the period.


This is a tricky question. The more one looks into the question of who the aristocracy we’re it becomes more ‘fuzzy’. When most non-historians are asked to explain aristocrats, the answer is most often related to wealth, power, nobility and the status they hold in a social setting. However, the answer is not that simple and arguably doesn’t have a definitive answer.  Greek aristocracy originated as a term for those who ran government and made important decisions and therefore had power over the society as they ruled. The Romans then adapted their view of aristocracy into one that was used to refer to hereditary distinction which would then be the framework for the term throughout European history. Aristocracy is, as mentioned, not an easy term to define but I think it is best kept unclear and instead of trying to give a solid definition to aristocracy, allowing the definition to flow and fit its purpose and instead try to best understand how the aristocracy conducted themselves and the impact they had on the period.


## slide power
- The aristocracy's long history could be its reason for power.
- The horse is the emblem of the aristocracy. The horse and the aristocracy both share connotations of power and status given to the aristocracy through the use of the horse. (Cannadine, Aspects of Aristocracy. p.184)
- Traditional aristocracy being the people of the government gives an obvious sense of power.
- Landowners control society through prices of land
- Slavery was a massive source of income and power through display, with grand gardens to distinguish them and keep the aristocracy exclusive.



It could be argued, as Cannadine does in his book aspects of aristocracy, that aristocracy has a long history that could be the reason for the power and authority enjoyed by the aristocracy. Cannadine says that the horse is the recognised emblem of the aristocracy which both share connotations of power and status. So, the argument here is that because of the history and etymology of the word  the aristocracy enjoys its power because of the social connotations engrained into society through history which gives a sense of power through society.
It can also be argued that traditionally aristocracy enjoyed power because of their status and position within society. This fits the original Greek view of aristocracy who saw the aristocracy as people of Government, in today’s setting this would be the House of Commons or the House of Lords. John Cannon explains in his book “The Aristocratic Century” that at the beginning of the eighteenth century the House of Commons had supremacy in financial matters. As well as this landlords and landowners were often regarded as aristocracy due to their wealth, which incidentally gave them power. Being landowners gives them power over the rest of society in the sense that they control prices and therefore the entire workings of the social classes of Britain. The aristocrats therefore have power through their wealth or through their political position in the Government. As well as land ownership it is important to mention the link between slavery and aristocracy. Slavery was a massive source of income for the aristocrats and was a way to exercise their power over people. And as important as landownership is for the aristocracy they often gained and maintained land through slavery. Their land was a way of showing the ‘normal’ people their status and making it clear they are powerful and wealthy.


## slide society
- Possibly the most commonly known link between aristocracy and society is its link with slavery.
	- Aristocrats were 'showing off' to the people about their wealth through their gardens the slaves tended too.
- Also the political and economical link between aristocrats and society as they were the primary providers of employment.


The first, possibly most commonly known link between aristocracy and society is the link between aristocracy, society and slavery. This also incorporates the link between land and society, as aristocrats often had extravagant gardens and other land that required constant attention which was what the slaves were primarily used for. This shows how the aristocracy were trying to ‘show off’ to the rest of society and possibly create a divide to keep a certain exclusivity to the aristocracy. It is also important to mention how this leads to a sense of admiration towards the aristocrats. This admiration achieved by the displays of wealth gives makes the aristocrats seem better than the ‘normal’ people which embeds a sense of authority and status to the aristocrats throughout the rest of society.
There is also a more economical/political link between aristocrats and society as aristocrats weren’t only landowners but the main providers of employment in Britain. This means society is at the mercy of the aristocrats economically which affects the relationship and attitudes towards the aristocracy.
