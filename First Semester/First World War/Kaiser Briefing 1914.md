## battle of Isonzo

- Italian Morale damaged
- 11 battles 

# ottoman empire/Baltics
Bad railway networks

Ottoman army is two tiered in some areas

### ottoman attack on Suez canal 1-3 Feb 1915
- 20,000 soldiers over desert
	- try and cross canal with attack
- British put troops from India here as well as boats 
	- British were ready for this 

### plans develop for taking Constantinople
- if you can get forces into sea of Marmora then ottomans will roll over
	- utter nonsense 

##### allied attack on Dardanelles 
gets no where
battle ships run into mine fields 
they pull back 
- then have to launch military operation to Gallipoli to control one half 

#### Gallipoli 25 April 1915 
- Turks hold high ground 
- Brits and Kiwis cant fight their way out 
- Jan 1916 with prospect of German intervention 
	- COMPLETE DISASTER

# Iraq

All British Navy battleships are ran on Oil so they need to keep Iraq and Persia in there side 
- decide they want to take control of Basra to defend oil pipeline 
- imperialistic Britain pushes up the rivers towards Baghdad 
	- looks like Britain is going to take control 
- Germany intervenes and high quality Turkish army arrives in Baghdad 
	- Brits pushed back to Kut-el-Amara and then surrounded and defeated
	- massive humiliation in 1916 just after Gallipoli 
- Ottomans push south and Brits flood Basra with forces and keep Basra
