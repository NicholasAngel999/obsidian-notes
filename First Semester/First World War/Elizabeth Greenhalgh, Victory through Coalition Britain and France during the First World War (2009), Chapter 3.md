# What does the conduct of the Battle of the Somme tell us about Allied strategy in 1916?

- as result of failed endeavours in France 1915 planning for 1916 began with conference 
- Marked end of Frances domination of the military alliance 
	- only joint battle of the war [end 42]
- New Armies inexperienced
	- possibly doesn't expect much 
- British opinions of their ally were no more complimentary. Haig (who had succeeded Sir John as CinC) had thought that the French gave ‘a distinctly bad performance’[43]
- Britain thinks France is completely incompetent and France believes Britain isnt pulling its own weight 
- The essential element was that of unity of purpose and of timing: only when all the Allies were ready would coordinated attacks take place on all fronts so as to cause maximum disruption to the enemy 
- Haig was certainly willing to fall in with Joffre’s general ideas. Joffre’s proposal to make the Franco-British operation one continuous front (instead of trying to pinch out the enormous German salient from the sides, as in 1915) had its advantages. Both British and French inner flanks would be protected in such an operation. [45]
- effect of German attack were immediate on Somme 
	- relative contributions of the French and the British were reversed 
	- Verdun swallowed resources 
		- timing become more crucial either wait for more guns and munitions but risk French unable to hold out at Verdun 
		- or attack sooner and risked defeat through insufficient preparation
	- Thirdly, the strategic objectives of the operation, a united allied push on all fronts, were thrown into doubt.
