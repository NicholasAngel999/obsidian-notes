Which development was most significant battlefield advantage by 1918?


-	Cavalry would typically be the main supplier in regards to the movement element of combat, be it the hammer and anvil tactics of the medieval ages or the harassment of enemy assets
-	However during the war the significance and capability of cavalry diminished 
-	Germany moved its cavalry to the Eastern front, dismounting most of the, most horses where used to draw artillery
-	Cavalry played a negligible role in Ludendorff’s offensives.
-	France maintained two cavalry corps which they used to reinforce defensive phases of battle
-	Tanks where useful for the allied offensive but not essential for their success
o	Never used in Italy
o	Although there where plans to use them in Spring 1918 on the Italian front
-	A few tanks used in Macedonia and eight saw action in Gaza
-	If fighting continued an extra year tanks may have seen more use, but only the western front possessed both the appropriate terrain and the infrastructure for 1918 tanks
-	Tanks mainly used by Britain and France (The US nor Germany, did not use them as heavily)
-	The AEF’s tank corp achieved little due to;
o	Spring 1918 decision to rush infantry and machine gunners across the Atlantic at the expense of other army branches
o	Production difficulty
	Engine gears not under manufacture
	Armour plate supplier described as ‘chaotic’
	Unsatisfactory factory conditions
	A failed order for 4,800 tanks in 1918 for the American government
-	British tanks first to see action, but both France and Britain's tank programs existed independently 
-	Many senior figures in both nations military saw tanks as unproven and ineffective
o	Winston Churchill and Lieutenant-Colonel Ernest Swinton of Britain
o	Colonel Jean Estienne in France
-	Until the summer of 1918, the contribution of tanks was ‘patchy and small’
-	They were endorsed as Infantry support devices, not in the mass break through sense we typically see them in today
-	Until June-July of 1918 tanks did little to justify the hopes placed in them
o	76 tanks lost in the French offensive of Cemin des Dames on April 16 1917 (121 where deployed)
o	Deplyed at La Malmaison, when many broke down and where outshone by the artillery bombardment
o	3,000 renaults were ordered in September 1917 , but only one was available march of 1918 due to design difficulties (British turret and armour plating being seen as unsuitable)
-	Renaults arrived in substantial numbers and took part in a successful counter offensive on 31st May in Marne
-	Tanks became used exclusively in larger operations
-	This was due to the speed in which they could advance operations
-	The latter sphere of 1918 the Western Front saw a transition point in logistics
-	If the allies had superior resources, these resources where in the wrong place: either the US or the Empire Overseas
-	This was the opposite to the Central Powers, who formed a smaller compact territorial block with interior lines of communication and one of the Worlds Finest railway networks due to German investment before the war, to the point it mitigated any supply issues created by the occuptations in Belgium, Frane and Russia
-	The German army had an acute horse shortage
-	Horses had their rations cut in half due to food shortages, leading to the number of horses falling by 30%
-	Germany was forced to seize 140,000 Ukrainian horses
-	The German army simply had too little motor transport, and light railways struggled to assist in the terrain around the Old Somme Battlefield
-	Before the war Germany imported over 90% of its oil requirements, Stockpiles accounted for a tenth of the countries war time consumption, with two small oil fields accounting for the other tenth
-	Germanys fuel consumption doubled between 1915-17
o	The U-Boat campaign contributed to this
-	By 1918 the BEF’s Railway Operating division had 18,500 personal and operated 1,486 locomotives running the Nord System
-	The BEF had 368,000 horses and 82,000 mules, the US could also provide 21 million horses to spare
-	Field railways where used to fill in the gaps the Horses cannot cover



Inteligence-In the relm of inteligence, the allies and the Germans before 1918 were evenly matched. Both also failed to plan any significant informant network in the home countries of the enemy. However, due to Germany occupying areas of France, Belgium, and all of Luxemburg the Allies were able to pull off primitive informant networks that Germany simply couldn’t match. This allowed the allies to watch out for German trains and sumise where they were going and the size of the army being moved and allowed them to figure out the area where the ‘Michle’ attack would happen. 
 Durong the war, Britian had 130 networks of 4,360 agents.  
By Feb 1918 infomation was placed in the local Lux nuwspaper ‘Der Landwrit’, which was seen as so unimportant by the Germans they allowed its export to Switzerland, form where it would reach Paris within 5 days.  
When the Germans started using radio in 1915, the French were able to intercept the singals and through the war would break over 30 Germany cypheres. 
 Interogation of enemy prisoners was also a way that the allies were able to get lots of infomation, with intergations leading them to a greater understanding of the Michle attack. 
 However there were still issues. The Allies didn’t know everything about the Michle, Mars, and Georgette attacks and the force of the attacks took them somehwat by suprise. The attack on Chemin des Dames, however, was a total suprise and slughtered the French 6th army  
By the middle of 1918, however, the situation was more under control. The Lundendorff offences in June and July were fully perepaired for, and the French not only held them off but prepaired counter attacks on the German forces


gas-In 1918, 52% of all gas attacks occured, and nearly half of all gas related fatalities  
Between kuly 1917 and June 1918 only Germany could mass produce gas  
The British Livens projector was a type of mortar that shot gas that the Germans copied and used to Great effect against Italy. However, it wasn’t as usful against the Allies. Even worse, the German copy was expensive, whereas the Livens was cheap. This resulted in the Germans abondoning projectors and using only shells 
By 1918 the Germans added HE into their mustarg gas shells. This meant the distinctive pop sound of gas beinbg relased was muffled but decreased the quantity and spread the gas around in less concentration. None the less the gas could linger for days or weeks and masks were uneffective in this case  
The best measure the allies took were deffencive. The French finally canged their reporators from the outdated M2 to the ARC, outmatcehd by the British SBR (the best of the whole war) 
British gas attacks were limmited to projectors that were used in between large battles and on resting units. The British took until September to recreate mustarg gas despite knowing what it was made of and the first French usage only came in June 
The British increased chlorine production tenfold in 1918, and the French even more so 
The Germans, once on the retreat, were also facing issues. The German gas mask was only usful for a few hours and was mainly made of rubber, which was becoming harder to find. Furthermore, the filter mouthpeice was cumbersome and large and hard to change and contaminated clothing was hard to replace  
Whilst gas shells were used against the Hindenburg line the Allies used the shells less and less and they advanced to minimise the loss of French civilians. Furthermore, the allies found it increasingly tough to set up their projects as they advanced which had been their main way of delivering gas attacks  
However, as the war came to an end the Germans were totally outclassed in production. They could produce 14 tons of mustard gas a day, but the allies forecast the USA would produce 200, the British 100, and the French 80

To make it short Allied intelligence only really worked well in the summer of 1918, and allowed them to basically stall and stop all German advances. Allied gas attacks were lack luster but by the end of the war the German’s couldn’t keep up with gas production and didn’t have the ability to protect themselves as well


Intelligence not work until summer 1918 but then its goooooood



# core criticism of stormtrooper tactics 

only worked with surprise 

Really good way of getting best part of army killed 


# how did they gather intelligence 

French somewhat behind the lines 
- specifically train movements 

Interrogating prisoners 

Germans start using radio because we go Kaboom with communication lines 
- French break over 30 German codes 

Ariel reconnaissance is limited 
- not too helpful but they do try 


Agent networks 
- Allies are running espionage like enemy's 
- Belgium and occupied France dont like being occupied 
- Every railway Junction in these areas is covered by agents 


# contribution of chemicals 

German maintain advance in this 
- allies focus on defensive aspect of this 
	- British and French make new gas masks 
	- British quoted as best 

Germans diversified gasses used 

Mustard gas effective 
- until we alter gas masks 
- mustard gas is effective at making soldiers useless for a while 
	- blistered body cant move well 


# tanks 

not terribly useful 
 terrain is difficult 
 very expensive 
 The mental impact of seeing a tank come at you is more impactful than a tank actually is
