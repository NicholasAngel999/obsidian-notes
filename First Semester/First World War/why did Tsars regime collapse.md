[[USSR dominance reading]]


3.3 million refugees by end of 1915 
	further 500,000 in 1916 

3.3 million refugees on road was underestimate and by 1917 17.5 million people fleeing Russian advance (5% of Russian population)

Strikes break out which are dealt with poorly 
	unarmed un-unionised workers shot upon [kostroma]
		greatest strike occured with 30 bolsheviks workers were arrested due to [alleged] connections to Germany - saw 150,000 workers rise up against authorities and strikes

By early 1915 there were issues in factories as untrained, mostly female workers, took the positions of trained and highly skilled workers who were whisked off to the front lines. This was compounded with food shortages and the start of inflation

Tsar still dealing with memory of defeats in 1915 when he decided to take personal control of the army and opened himself up to personal criticism 

Crisis in August 1915 resulted in the collapse of Russia’s civilian government due to the army retreating from all of Galicia and Poland and government ministers’ vocal objections and fears to the Tsar taking command, resulting in their dismissal


Because of war funding they literally just printed money 
	inflation gets bad 
	goods taken from civilians into military 

peasants horded produce 

became clear that transport and supply chains were a bigger problem than overall national shortage. There was sufficient grain to feed the country but it was not being supplied to many areas that needed it.

There was a mood of political dissent, and ‘anti-dynasty‘ sympathies were developing 

Pavel Melnikov, head of the Kadet Party in the Duma, made a highly inflammatory speech about treason and incompetency in the government. Due to his respectable standing, this was highly provocative 

Conspiracy began circulating of the ‘German party’ at court and in government [and about Rasputin]were rife. This was made worse by the German heritage of Tsarina Alexandria 

By 1916, the Tsar was being counselled to open up to reaffirms [that still left him the total ruler of Russia by default] such as to appoint (not have elected) a leader of the Council of Ministers. This got so pressurized that even the British ambassador Buchanan told the Tsar as such

Protests began to rage out in Russia. The 1917 International Women’s Day was used by Russian women to protest food shortages. Not long after a Soviet formed in Petrograd to organise strike movements

By Feb 1917 there were critical shortfalls in home/work hearing resources, causing homes to fall to as low as 10c and workplaces as low as 6c.


The Tsar basically underestimated or didn't fully understand the situation Russia faced and started to make reforms way too late 

Jewish were behind the line saboteurs 
- ready made scapegoat 
- higher ups blame the military losses on the Jewish population 
- pre-existing antisemitism 

possibly try and force out the Jewish 

for 60 miles behind western front its marshal law as there is no local government 
- military personnel in control



[[diplomacy]]


# French invasion 1812
Napoleon army invades but gets pushed out in winter 


# Crimean war 1853-56
wear opponents down to negotiation 

# Russo-Turkish war 1877
- apparent win
- but a much weaker opponent than before 

# Russo-Japanese war 1904-1905
lost both fleets 

army bad start 

country bankrupt itself and political disorder


Grand Nicholas appointed the leader of army at this point 
- leaders of army are aristocracy 
- not put there because of skills but accident of birth 



# railways 
distances for railways and things are larger 

they aren't as popular or common so its hard to move it around 

##### coal supply 
grain and coal is in the south 
- coal has to be moved efficiently which is hard because transport system is inheritably inefficient 


# Rasputin 

He arrives in St Petersburg - ladies of St Petersburg don't know what sin is so cant be saved so helps them sin
gets into royal family 

- doctor for haemophilia of royals son

Rasputin has hold over royal family so....
- if we get rid of Rasputin we win the war 


# collapse in 1917 

Urban working class reach end of tether and then the troops side with protesters and police just dip because like how you beating the army 

- panic in higher of Government 
	- what they do is to try and keep the system and replace the Tsar 
	- Grand Duke Michael supposed to take over because Tsar son is too young 
	- then Michael says no and we end up with the Government which ends the system
