Cambridge history of war, part I chapter 6, Endgame  

 

Desertion rates were very low but 20% of the German army ’got lost’ on its way from East to West (p153) 
The allies only ever went as far as their artillery would fire before brining it forwards, meaning that they always had she'll cover (p153) 
On the 4 August 1914 the French retook Soissons and took 35,000 soldiers prisoner and 700 guns (p153) 
The British struck through the Amiens on 8 August with superiority in air and artillery and they were all equips with Lewis guns and mortars, with each battalion accompanied by 6 tanks. The Germans stiffened 27,000 casualties and 15,000 soldiers simply surrendered (pp153-154) 
In August 1918, the German army had 228,000 casualties, 21,00 dead, and 110,000 missing (p145) 
On September 13 the Americans captured 13,000 soldiers on the Sailient (p154)

Set reading: 

 

By the end of the war, the German army loved 420,000 men wounded or dead, 340,000 were ‘missing’ and 1 million were off sick. This paired with 1 million casualties in the whole of the Ludendorff offences and losses disproportionately in the best units in the German army meant it was incapacitated (pp23-24) 
German units were exhausted by a mix of being on the front so long and fewer men being able to man the font lines (p34) 
German frontline soldiers were highly vulnerable to illness and were poorly fed (p25) 
Throughout Autumn (’fall’) the strength of battalions continued to fall (p26) 
The obedience of German elite soldiers changed as they began negotiating if they would attack based on factors such as perceived importance (p27) 
There was an inability to send soldiers to ’quiet places’ as there were few, and there was no 'replacement pool’ left (p27)  
New recruits to the German army were of an 'unmilitary disposition’ (p28) 
The soldiers of the West had been rotated so much they had little exposure to French lives, but in the East the released German prisoners came back with socialist/communist ideals (p31) 
The allied leaflet campaign left many soldiers questioning the war (p33) 
According to the OHL, the Homefront demoralised the units (p33) 
There was a growing rift between the regular soldiers and the men of the Etappe (the staff, Home Army, and anyone seen as benefiting from the war) which produced tensions  (p36) 
Not everyone in ‘the rear’ lived well, but to front line soldiers it was better than what they had (p37) 
Soldiers were increasingly irritated by higher officials 'excessively optimistic’ reports (p37) 
After the Ludendorff failures, soldiers began siding with ant-war protestors and strikers  
The German army found itself in the midst of an aging problem as the war came to its final months (pp40-41) 
To fill shortages the OHL took prisoners from Russia, older people, and essential workers [Stay Home, Stay Safe, Protect the NHS-it is currently 10:15 PM] (p41) 
The Germans was beginning to recruit from younger groups who weren’t from backgrounds typically fond of the military more than they were recruiting from ones who were, resulting in increasing insubordination (pp42-44) 
Germany changed the punishment for military offences in 1917 which was effecting desertion and disobedience in 1918 (p46) 
In May 1918, a train of 76 NCOs and 555 men arrived with 3 NCOs and 80 men missing (p48)
