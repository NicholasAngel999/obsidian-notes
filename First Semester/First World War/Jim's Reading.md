What went right and wrong for Germany

# Right
- made civilians run drills making them look like German reserve
- increased artillery bombardment in border
- released carrier pigeons with false info
- artillery barrage
- 18th army took second line of Haig Position and took 7000 prisoners and 90 guns
- 2 days advance from Michael pushed Brits 40 miles behind Somme and Crozat canna 
- Brits lost 200,000 killed or wounded and 90PoW as well as 1,300 guns
- 3 days after Michael Germans advanced 20 miles
- Craze to plunder because of lack of food and water some say drove Germans forward
- 15 Billion marks were received for the 8th bomb attempt after victory (highest ever)
- scaled down Georgette plan caught Brits of guard 
- sudden switch to champagne region initially took allies by surprise 



# Wrong
- German had no effective answer to tanks 
	- nor own effective tanks
- German 13mm anti tank gun required multiple gunners to focus on the same area of a single tank to even penetrate armour
- creeping artillery barrage was out of sync with soldiers and soon outpaced them
- first wave only moved 3 miles and was supposed to move 6 
	- lost 78,000 men _highest lost in a single day for Germans_
- artillery gone to far
	- holes in German line and officers split from soldiers
- Bavarian units discovered 2nd line practically intact
- light machine guns and mortars were left behind as their gunners picked up rifles to join advance 
- Ludendorff's guns only put 1/6 of British artillery out of action 
- Germans took heavy casualties but less than British 
- German plan to push through 'empty fields' were actually full of canals villages and forests
- Ludendorff switched tact - 23rd march sent to the 17th to Aras rather than up North 
- on 27th Ludendorff refocused on French 
	- 2nd army split from 18th to go and attack Amiens
	- German army ground to halt exhausted from fighting for 6 days 
- Half of German reserves already committed 
	- horses unable to keep up 
	- Anglo French line holding but pushed back 
- Scared allies into unified front with Foche in command 
- Brits lost 178,000 men French lost 248,000 men and Germans lost 239,000
- all mobile forces exhausted 
- German general staff complained of no overall goal
- 3rd April German attacks lost cohesion and were being launched _helter-skelter_
- 13mm anti tank guns overheated and inaccurate
- Germans so exhausted 13 battalions of stormtroopers were dissolved into attack divisions 
	- you know the most effective battalions
