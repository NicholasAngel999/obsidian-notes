Georges Henri Diplomacy in jay winter pp495 

How did the negotiating positions of the belligerents develop between 1914 and 1917? 

 

- 15th December 1914- Britian, France, and Russia agree not to sign separate peace treaties with the Central Powers (p495) 
- From the start of the war the Allies were committed to reducing the power of Germany (p495) 
- In September 1914, the French government took the stance that they wished to liberate rightfully French territory and to ‘end Prussian militarism’, meaning a dramatic change or end of the Reich (pg95) 
- France and Russia had agreed to coordinate their war aims so that France could meet its aims and Russia could annex territory in German Poland. (p495) 
- The German negotiation position with Russia in 1914/15 was weak due to the Russians refusing to leave the alliance, thus resulting in German plans to force Russia into peace by taking away Poland (p497) 
- Due to the allies entering war technically on behalf of Belgium defence Germany wish to conclude the war with Belgium with promises of full restoration and a military alliance and custom union. However, the Allies fought hard against this in 1915 so it didn’t happen (p497) 
- For a time it looked like Austo-Hungary and Germany would conclude a peace with the Serbian army who slowed down their efforts correspondingly. In response to this, however, the allies began promising Serbia its Yugoslav dreams, some openly and publically and some only privately as not to antagonize Italy and the other Balkan powers (p498) 
- In February 1916, at the Rome Conference, the allied nations agreed on making one united political and one military council to govern the war, making the allies a more unified political as well as military entity (p499) 
- In 1915 Germany began negotiations with Austria to bring them in closer millitarally and economically, which would virtually make the empire a satilite of Germany. After Austro-Hungarian stalling and many back and forths these negotiations broke down in 1917 and led to decliniing relations between to two powers (pp500-501) 
- The Central powers were able to use the Greek case of the Allies landing troops in Salonica and forcing the abdication of King Constantine in favour of more pro-Allied politicians rather than neutrality to argue that the Allies had lost the moral high ground in 1915 as they had violated Greek neutrality (pp502-503) 
- Germany was at a weaker point to talk to the USA than the Allies were as Wilson favored an Allied over Central Alliance victory as the Allies were also liberal democracies (p503) [with the MAJOR exception of Russia] 
- The Central Powers position was so weak that, as early as 1915, Colonel House had managed to get the British and Wilson to agree that if the allies were stuck in a difficult military position then Wilson would arbitrate a peace talk, favoring the allies with terms of France receiving Alcese-Lorrein, Russia receiving Constantinople [because every empire loves to give up their capital city] and Belgium restoration. In return for this the Central Powers would get some Allied colonies [because that would go so well]. If Germany refused, the US would ‘probably’ get involved on the allied side (p504) 
- On 12th December 1916, Germany began to make overtures of peace, proposing the renstatment of the status quo in the West and some gains for Germany in the East, which saw the backing of the German upper classes who saw more ability to settle/ colonise the comparitivly sparser populated East. However, after Washington offered to mediate and asked for German and Austrian war aims they remained silent, allowing the allies to rebuff the peace talks in 1917 whilst stating their war aims for Alcase-Lorrein and partition of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (p505) 
- There were no real negotiations besides some ‘inconclusive soundings’ before 1917 (p506) 
- in 1914 Berlin was dreaming of ‘Mittleuropa’ (a central Europe with a German dominated state) that would be acheived through a customs union between A-H, a free Poland, and Belgium (if possible). However, the Germans, particularally Hollweg, did not yet know about their defeat at the Battle of the Marne (pp506-507) 
- Mittleuropa was at threat as early as 1915, however, and it soon became clear that, even after the Russian exit of the war, the only way to force the allies to accept Mittleeuropa was to force a small victory or stalemate (p507) 
- In 1916 Lloyd George was made PM after a political coup ousted Asquith, who was considering making peace after the Battle of the Somme. George’s view was to see the war out ‘till the end’, and thus made it harder for the Germans to negotiate peace with a Britian who now wanted to end the war squarly on their own terms (p508) 
- By 1917 the situation had changed. France’s failed Nevile attack demoralised the whole nation and saw muntines break out. In Germany starvation kicked in and the A-H Empire was facing the cirisis that would see it disolved a year later. Russia had left but was only replaced with the USA (p512)  
- Germany proposed a peace in 1917 to keep the Western front stable and to establish Germans based Polish and Baltic protectorates in the East out of Russia’s crimbelng empire. However, the allies beleived this was a trick despite the Germans being seriouse (p512) 
- In France, the rise of Clemenceau put an end to any notion other than victory over the German Empire (p516)


[[Land warfare and Diplomacy]]


- **Initial Goals:** Reducing German power and liberating French territories.
- **Expansion of Aims:** Annexation of Polish territories by Russia and support for Serbian aspirations of a Yugoslav state.
- **Unity:** The formation of unified political and military councils in 1916 strengthened Allied coordination.
- **Post-1917:** A focus on total victory over the German Empire, particularly after the rise of Clemenceau in France.

**Central Powers' War Aims:**

- **Early Goals:** Peace with Belgium and a defensive alliance, as well as a separate peace with Russia.
- **Mittleeuropa:** A German-dominated Central Europe, achieved through a customs union with Austria-Hungary and a free Poland.
- **Weakening Position:** As the war progressed, the Central Powers' position weakened, leading to a shift towards defensive strategies and peace proposals.
- **1917 Peace Proposal:** Germany proposed a peace to stabilize the Western Front and establish German-controlled protectorates in Eastern Europe. However, the Allies rejected this proposal.

**Key Points:**

- The Allies' war aims evolved over time, becoming more ambitious as the war progressed.
- The Central Powers' war aims were initially more modest but became increasingly ambitious with the hope of creating a German-dominated Europe.
- The diplomatic landscape was complex, with shifting alliances, changing power dynamics, and evolving war aims.
- The war ultimately led to the defeat of the Central Powers and the dissolution of the German, Austro-Hungarian, and Ottoman empires.
