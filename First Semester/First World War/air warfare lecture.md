# Pre war 
Dirigibles 
- long rigid balloon 
	- propellers to move it around 

Germans love this and make Zeppelins
- however it is 1903 that wright brothers make plane for first time so how good is it going to be 


Both opportunity and threat with aircraft 

*Bristol Boxkite 1910*
*Libya* **used in Italy Libya 1911-1912

aircraft are used as an ad on
- sort of used in conjunction with the cavalry
- aircraft is too dependent on weather 
- also not very night capable 

# Air combat 
mostly used for reconnaissance

French man straps machine gun to aircraft instead of the shot guns and pistols they were using 

### Roland Garros 
French man makes the metal plates on propellers that mean the bullets bounce back instead of breaking it 

Germans then make a Synchronised firing mechanism that only fires when there is space for it 


# 1915
first fighter aircraft 
*Eindecker*
**Fokker scourge

Germans now have powerful fighter aircraft and allies have no answer to this 
- Germans have huge advantage first thing in morning 
- harder to see them against sun as it rises

Older aircraft get relegated to other tasks 

cant control or talk to planes as they are up, they dont have radios yet 
- by the end of the war they start to develop very basic radios 
- they are using hand signals 


Battles fought on our side of trenches 
- so we can regain shot down planes and pilots 
- also keeps new technologies secret 


# 1917 
*Bloody April*

battle of arras 
Germans blow allies out the sky 


# involvement in land warfare 

They want to try and machine gun the trenches 
- this is useless they just take cover 

Rather just use artillery


# Strategic Bombing 

1916 figure out how to hit zeppelins out the sky

Germans go higher to where crew are wearing oxygen masks but they are woefully inaccurate


### Allied retaliation 
cant get loads of Germany due to issues with how far you can get
