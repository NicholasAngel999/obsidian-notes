David Woodward: Trial By Friendship Anglo American relations 

- expectation America would play dominant role in this war *page 81
- Pershing was not ready for the realities of the attrition warfare the Western Front had devolved into. The US Military Academy taught the ideas of manoeuvre and offensives as the lessons it learnt from the American Civil War, and thus Pershing had a strikingly 19th century attitude to warfare *page 81*
- Should be placed between the French and British troops so that they could be **directed by the French and Supplied by the British** *page 82*
- British wanted the American divisions to replace the French in North Belgium 
	- mainly to force them to use British supply lines and limit independence of US Army *page 82*
- Pershing suspected British as trying to harness American military power to their own *page 82
- Pershing believed that by pleasing French he could prevent British from proposing Anglo-American front which the British would control *page 82*
	- **The French, who sought to protect their great-power status through aligning American forces with their own, could be counted upon in the future to oppose British efforts to create any Anglo-American front.
- Pershing desired **American arms to dominate the battlefield** and so all plans framed with this goal *page 82/83
- Pershing wanted peace through victory *page 83*
	- not victory through peace, tells you a bit about how he treats the war
- Wilson "peace without victory"
	- world safe through democracy 
- Wilson desired ‘victory through peace’, whereas Pershing and the other AEF leaders wanted ‘peace through victory’ *page 85* 
- The Americans upon arriving refused to alleviate any British trench under the guise of what good would it do- ‘if The British cannot hold... their own line, certainly our entrance therein cannot produce any decisive results’. They also didn’t want to be placed in between the British and French, as the fear was it would relegate the AEF to a secondary role *page 85* 
- America planned for a large offensive in 1919, but realised that public opinion demanded results in 1918. Therefore, small scale operations were planned for 1918 *page 85* 
- Pershing wished to advance upon Metz. First, he wished to take the railway lines in the Lorrein region, as this, he hoped, would damage German supply lines so badly the Germans would withdraw beyond the Rhine or even to Belgium. He also saw it as taking vital coal and iron deposits away from Germany, thus crippling their industry *page 85* 
 - The AEF’S attack would be supplemented with British and French assaults on the German defenses *page 85*
- ‘Pershing believed he had almost nothing to learn from the French and British officers' *page 88* 
- ‘Pershing feared the acceptance of Angelo-French...tactics would force a subordinate role on the United States’ *page 89* 
- The general staff, unlike Wilson, wanted a 'strategy of annihilation’ that was to be made by ’weight of numbers’ *page 96*
