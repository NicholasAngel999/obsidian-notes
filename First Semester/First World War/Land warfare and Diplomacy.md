# difficult situation
War is not just like developing science
- we make something new 
	- opposition make something to beat it 

So like tanks which are used prematurely its because its hard to wait to use 

# why was defence so much more expensive for Somme for British 

British just throw whatever they have in the path of the Germans 
- Germans attack is bloody good 


# British Infantry 

British is now using conscripts by 1917 so the young fit men who were good Marksmen before are now less so 

so we reorganise into specialist platoons 
#### example
- town cricketers are now bombers who throw grenades because they are practiced throwing 

now we have a *swiss army knife* for the situation 


by 1917 we move to light machine guns 
- rifle ammunition 
- moveable 
- game changer 


# Artillery 

## Suppression 
- just enough to keep peoples heads down for an advantage 

## Neutralisation 
stun and daze the opponent 

## destruction 
- obvious 
- everyone is thinking of this by 1917 

they start to make a move towards neutralisation 

and things become more scientific and accurate 

- we also now get more accurate maps that allows us to do this
- increase quality control of raw materials 
- every single gun gets calibrated 
- start taking more interest in wind speeds and weather 
- now have an intelligence system that can work out things like where HQ is
- Rolling Barrage
	- walking wall of shell fire
	- line of shells landing 
	- keep advancing that line across German position 
	- we walk behind that line 
	- now were in the Trench so when they come out their shell holes were there to surprise them 

# defence 

Verdun and Somme make Germans press reset button on how they do defence 

they start with a strategy of if they lose ground they counter attack and take it back but you loose more men 
- this is also destroying morale 

#### Hindenburg and Ludendorff take over and know something needs to change 
reverse slope defence 
- put defence at back of hill

more sophisticated approach 

then you create a layer defence 
move away from trench and use pill poxes
embrace sacrificing front line 

#### battle zone 
checked pattern of pill boxes for battle

then counter attack units and artillery at the back and we wait until the enemy is exhausted and then counter attack

GERMANS BECOME MUCH MORE FLEXIBLE 
not losing lives for ground

Allies do change attack methods but this does work pretty well

# German attacks become known as Stormtrooper tactics 

Germans scale up these Stormtrooper attacks

### Stormtroopers 

high explosives and gas barrage to suppress allied artillery 
- shock and awe 

Don't try and take positions try and sneak past it 
- then in logistic area where they dont expect you 


They perfect this strategy 

*HOWEVER
- you have to have brave fit healthy gung-ho men 
So they create a 2 tier army 
- Storm/Attack divisions
	- young guys 
	- best kit
	- good food
	- lots of rest 
- then the 2nd rate 
	- middle age 
	- not great food 
	- or rest
	- or even best kit 
This would be great if you're A team can win the war but does it work
