Ariel achievements of civilians encouraged militarization of aviation 

_The competition for national superiority in aviation had cultural and imperial overtones. Germans believed that the Zeppelin symbolized their presumed cultural supremacy, while the French imagined that the initiative necessary to use airplanes accorded with traditional Gallic audacity. British aerial advocates like Rudyard Kipling viewed the airplane as a tool to unify the Empire and to impress white superiority and control on non-white, colonial populations.

zeppelin had unrealistic expectations

Because of zeppelin potential as a bomber so German magazines mentioned plan of pre-emptive strike which heightened pre war tensions

aviators seen as a daredevils and heroes 

most armies and navies emphasised developing slow stable aircraft for reconnaissance
- they just kept using sport planes (racers) which were fast small and manoeuvrable
- these were armed and thrown back to the front lines - seen as wars greatest individual heroes

aircraft started as reconnaissance only but soon became an arm with up to 300,000 men 

improvement in reconnaissance for more effective rendering of ground forces and artillery reconnaissance 

armies with 200 frontline at start of war had between 2/3,000 aircraft at front of 1918 

_French produced some 88,000 engines to English and German totals of 41,000 each. By the last year of the war, the great powers were producing 2,000–3,000 planes and 2,000–4,000 engines a month_

makes a big deal of production and says French are wining war for industrial mobilisation 
- French essentially winning by producing more 

Revolutionary Hispano-Suiza V8 was a big deal as French Aero engine production was far far better than all other powers 

Hugo Junkers all metal airplane with cantilever wings

_1917, industrial mobilization would become even more critical for aviation as the airplane became indispensable to the conduct of the war._

1915 see more specialised aircraft types 

_Fokker’s fighter plane designs, from the first Eindecker, or monoplane, with a fixed forward firing machine gun, through the Dr1 Dreidecker, or triplane, of 1917–18, to the Fokker D7 of 1918, often considered the best production fighter of World War I, and his last parasol winged monoplane fighter, the D8, probably merit his selection as the best fighter plane designer of the war._

**They had to be simple enough to lend themselves to serial production yet of sufficient reliability and performance to remain effective under rapidly changing frontline conditions despite their limited combat life.
