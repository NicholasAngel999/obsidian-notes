[[1915 Land Warfare]]

only 1/3 of U-boats sea worthy for long trips other are coastal boats 

insurance premiums went through the roof because of sinkings and so government paid for losses to keep trade coming 
- so we keep Sven and our trade 

ramming was the most effective proactive way to deal with a U-boat 

convoys also work as they empty the oceans and make U-boats less valuable 


# allied blockade and central powers 
blockade causes German trade to half and then third by 1918 
- intercepted any vessel you think could be going to Germany 

invasion of Romania makes no military sense but does economic sense 

Germany does experience some urban famine 
- depends on class
- rural vs urban area 
- and other factors 

if its bad in Germany its worse in Austro-Hungarian 

if its bad in Austro-Hungary its even worse in Russia
