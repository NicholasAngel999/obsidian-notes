### Battle of Amiens
ausies and cannoks spearhead the attack 

2,000 aircraft and guns 
- Black day of the German army

looks like another battle of attrition 
Brits just shut it down 

Germany in nightmare position where there is nothing behind Haig's line 

they retreat and hope bad weather sets in and halts their pursuit
