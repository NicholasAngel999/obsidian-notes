[war is not merely an act of policy but a true political instrument a continuation of political intercourse carried on with other means]

Certain things which are a red line for either side 
- Alsace-Lorraine example 
	- until someone conceives there will be no peace settlement 



People have been sacrificed 
- changes domestic politics
	- if they don't get something out of the war these people died in vein 


_Lord Lansdowne_ vilified for his middle of the road view of just get along and stop war


# pope **Benedict XV

doing upmost to bring peace to Europe 

Most European countries have large Catholic following and so they have to listen to the pope



# **Colonel House & Woodrow Wilson

_not a colonel its a nickname_



# **Sixtus/sixte effect

Empress Zita - French 
- 2 brothers in Austrian army 
- 2 brothers in Belgian Army 

Sixte says things that could be viewed as confessing French control of Alsace Lorraine 
- uses this to boost morale later in war when released letter 


# United States Entry 
large parts of US still don't like being close to the Brits 

### German Americans 
- large German population 
	-  as well as Irish 


Wilson has to find a reason for people to rally behind 
[[U-Boats and maritime battles]]
U boats help a lot as it gives a reason for the US people to want to go to war 


**Zimmerman Telegram also helps 


# Wilson Issue the 14 Points 
Americas Agenda for peace
- Military starting to appear in Europe 
- starting motive to win war
