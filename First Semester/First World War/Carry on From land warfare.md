# western front 

Recaptured ground of Verdun 

German army been through meat grinder of Somme and Verdun 

British gain some ground Somme


looks as though 1916 worked in favour of Allies

Germany retreat to the Hindenburg Line 1917 
- shorter line easier to maintain 

British attack at Arras before the French 
- British suck in the German reserves 
- French strike in South Champagne region and Germans have to retreat to not be surrounded 

**This does not work!!!!

{attacks fail miserably} *for the French

French refuse to fight 
They will hold the position for defence only but mutiny breaks out 

Petain takes over 
- Court Marshal 
- Death sentence - we are still in charge 


Americans very impressive in the long run 
- *but they are not soldiers yet*


# Messines 

Dug 19 tunnels with rooms of explosives at the end

When the battle starts press kaboom 

**British move to much more ambitious plan 

- British think German morale is about to collapse 
	- They are wrong but they are in full belief 


# Battles of Cambrai 

Haig launches tank attacks 
- Nov & Dec 1917 

impressive tanks 
- ending campaign season on high 

Germans counter with stormtroopers and take back that region 

George wants to sack Haig but Haig has cons backing and so decides to just sack some other cons instead 


# Italian Front 

*Goes very badly for Allies 

Italian army bad way by 1917 

Germans followed by Austro-Hungarians launch stormtrooper attack against Italy 
- take 300,000 (1/6 army) prisoners 

British French and Americans rush to stabilise the line 
- Germans now leave the Austrians to it 

Allies taken Baghdad Dec 1917 
- militarily not that important but morally yeah 


# Eastern Front 

Russian provisional Govt. trapped 
- liberal reforms 
- death penalty gone 
	- soldiers misbehave 
- recover morale by combat units of women 
	- shame men by having women attack 
	- doesn't work just like gets women killed 


## Trotsky sent to sign peace to the Germans

- Russian view
	- war stopped
	- Govt. fallen 
	- Bolsheviks and non Russian troops fraternise with Germans 

Germany has won in the east 


[[How did US intend to use it military forces on Western Front]]
