# Drawing upon the example of Berlin in 1917, what were the main challenges for the German authorities in managing the food supply?

 - _The turnip was the main food the German government was trying to get Germans/ Berliners to eat. However, the sweet taste of the turnip made it a hated dish across Germany, and propaganda efforts to make the turnip seem good were showing turnip based dishes with increasingly fewer ingredients in 1917 (p190) 
- *By the summer of 1917, the turnip, itself a replacement for other foods, had to be replaced as Berlin ran out of turnips (p190)* 
- *Many German women saw the food stuffs and goods being given to them as 'artificial’, which caused them to question why they should give to the war effort (p190)*
- *Difference in what was and wasn't allowed in certain areas. Beer production was banned in the north so that crops could be used to make more nutritional foods, but as it was seen as cultural important in Bavaria it was allowed to continue (p191)* 
- *Coffee was seen as culturally important to Germany [viewed liked the British to tea] to such an extend that roasted beans were to be set aside in 1916 to be coffee substitutes. However, this plan had to be abandoned after the Romanian entry into the war. This ended up in what Berliners called 'ersatz ersatz’ [substituting the substitute] and resulted in illegal and sometimes dangerous substitutions for coffee (p191)* 
- *Merchants often offered substitutes that offered little taste resemblance to the real thing so long as it looked somewhat similar. Eggs became yellow power of ’indeterminate origin’ and washing soda mixed with starch became butter. It was bemoaned that the actual goods were gone but their prices were still there (pp191-192)* 
	- *When, in 1916, officials demanded that ersatz food have ingredients listed many were outraged, and found that 85% of pepper was made from ash (p192)* 
- *By 1917, 'substitute sickness’ became an issue, which was a mix of the body not taking in enough nutrients and the body taking in too much toxic or non-digestible substances passed off as food (p192)* 
- *Berliners became hesitant to buy ersatz food as the meaning shifting to ‘fake' or ’wretched' and many became concerned about the food itself (p192)* 
- *Anger of the Berlin/German public over exorbitant prices [for fake food] resulted in many farmers not going into markets in 1917 and thus cut off some food supply grown in Germany (p195)* 
- *Many women simply took large quantities of food at times, angry that they hadn't been able to get anything, meaning that some simply couldn't get food. This was made worse by police often viewing violence such as this as reasonable in the situation (p196)*  
- *In August, there was an alteration in German leadership based on the food issues. Bethmann was replaced with Michaelis as Chancellor (and was effectively puppet for the OHL). He replaced other individuals as well, and first took to taking on the black market that had caused many issues with the steady supply of food to Berliners (p198)* 
- *The German government also had an issue in supplying what they had promised. They promised jam, which was meant to be a symbol of government control and a suitable alternative to butter and to make bread nicer, yet it failed to appear (p199)* 
- *Failure to conduct a peace with Russia and the outset of the largely German caused Russian Revolution meant that it wasn’t possible to move food supplies through Russia or get access to food sources in areas such as Ukraine (p199)* 
- *There was issue in the distribution and allocation of food stuffs. German newspapers discovered that some nutrient foods like potatoes were being diverted to make Shcapps (on one case it was half a farmers entire crop) and food was unfairly distributed To groups such as those working in munitions factories (p199)* 
- *There were issues in buying food as well, as many regions exceeded price caps in buying food, forcing others to do the same. This meant farmers and manufacturers sent their food to areas paying the most instead of equally, and explained unequal distribution in goods like jam (p200)


- problems arouse in first turnip winter in the form of food substitutes such as loathed swede turnip - p190
- made Berliners bitter and therefore probably lowered morale for the war 
- Just before the institution of the KEA in 1916, the Bundesrat established the War Committee for Coffee, Tea, and Substitute Goods. Germans had to drink coffee with their Stulle, or coffee break sandwich; it was as basic an accompaniment to bread as the bread’s spread
- lack of coffee caused uproar in second year of the war
- the KEA attempted to take control of the situation, publishing lists of permitted substitutes for coffee (including ground walnut shells and corn powder) as well as for thousands of other food products— from 837 certified forms of substitute sausage to over 3,500 approved pseudo– soft drinks.
- summer 1917 demonstrations more violent than they had been
