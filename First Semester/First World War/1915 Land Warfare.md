Come to the conclusion they have to prioritise the east because of the collapse of the Austro-Hungarians 
- France is bigger danger but his hand is forced

Everything is about getting Russians of off the ottomans at first before they can move onto anything else 

# why is Germany so effective against Russia 
- They have surprise on their side and can attack from somewhere without the Russians knowing where
	- Russian intel is also shocking so they don't know what's going on at the front
- Germans hit with such fire power the Russians are shocked and confused and the Germans can just walk through 
- Resource management
	- take things as the Russians run away 
- Advanced weaponry so better equipped than the Russians 

### Russian conduct helped German victory 
- poor Russian infrastructure
	- train lines and such 
- Russian military just isn't as good 
- Russian high command doesn't trust its soldiers 
	- if they give order to retreat the whole army shall collapse 

## counter argument 
Russia is the punching bag in this war 

Winter is coming and Germany is moving forces away from the western front 

Italy is about to Join

Its not actually as bad as it initially seems




# firepower
take guns out of forts and put them on the battlefields

army needs big guns and now uses indirect fire 

slow moving massive guns 



# Trenches 
these are not new 
they have been around since pretty much gunpowder

20-30 feet deep to protect against explosive 
- also start burrowing 



# tanks
not actually war winning 


[[5 Nov reading static western front]]
