Germany's propogandists say look at our victories and look at Hindenburg

_Hindenburg and Ludendorff being like shadow Kaisers as they are pretty much running everything now_


Russia is gone!!!
this is great for Germany 
- Then they get Ukraine 
- but the people of Ukraine dont hand over their stuff
- victory in the east is somewhat economically hollow


Wheels are starting to wobble on Germany 

Until 1917 British have pulled a few punches such as when Danes take more food than they need and take it to Germany 

US is backing these *neutral* countries but now that they joined the war the blockade becomes even tighter 

Pres Wilson and 14 points
- completely opposed to allied leaders
- Wilson is selling liberation 

## OHL really need some big military wins 

1917 Allies have most forces western front 

1918 Germans have 4:3 numerical advantage on western front as Allies move forces to Eastern front 
- Germans can now 
	- send troops to help Ottomans
		- Oil
	- Send troops to Italy 
		- could knock Italy out war 
		- possible win there
		- So what - blow to morale of allies and will take forces to keep it and Americans will just come and liberate it 
	- why not stay on defensive 
		- cant afford to keep on going 
		- Americans are coming 



# operation michael
_21 march - 4th April
1918

British forced to throw everything they have in the path of the British 

### 28 march
week after first success another attack is launched 
Brits know down to the hour when the Germans will attack and so it goes nowhere


They must have Amiens
This has one of major transport links and they must keep it 

Germans can only come as far as the British retreat as they dont have the power to overtake it
