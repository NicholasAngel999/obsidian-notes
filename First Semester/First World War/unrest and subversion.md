# Germany attempt to turn the Ottoman empire into an asset 
- this should be a real issue for the British as they have regions that border the ottomans 
- Berlin have crude assumption that both ottomans and British colonials are Muslims and they think they can get all Muslims to rise up against brits 
- Religious divide stops this as ottomans and brits are split between Sunni and Shia 
	- ottomans have also just spent effort making its self secular and therefore this call is not genuine 
	- Arab under ottoman control aren't going to want to fight for them 


- Wassmuss and max von Oppenheim sent to Afghanistan
	- get Persians and Afghans to do guerrilla war against brits 
	- isn't terribly effective 
- Brits and Persians pretty close nothing much happens 
- only place any of this works is in lybia who were fighting the Italians and rise up against the Italians
- filled U-Boats with ammunitions and things to get new found allies supplies 
- start attacking into Egypt 
	- causes issues for British because their focus is higher up 
	- bribe them to stop with more money 
		- British already established colonial power 



# Arab revolt 1916 
not caused by British 
- fed up of ottomans and have been for ages 

these rebels then get trained by the British army??
maybe fight with them? 
- NOOOO 
- because then we have Christian fighters involved in Muslim war 
	- alienates people you're supposed to be with 
- so we take some Indian army troops to defend ports to not cause offense 


# Germany 

[karl leibknecht] create a dissonant left of spd and challenges government and says war must be stopped 
- this time a year later 20 socialists also vote no to war funding and 22 vote yes 
- he is put in prison for going against the war


NAVAL MUTINY *woooo*

# Ramsay MacDonald

leader of Labour party 
- pacifist 
- he then steps down as leader because like war isn't pacifist 

conscription changes things because it brings about more people also opposed to war 

10,000 members want a *Union for Democratic Control*

Government is tyring to square the circle - [Jim quote]

Conscientious objector
- Northampton for example has shoes so a lot of bootmakers 
- 'why are you against war'
	- insert Christian grouping 
		- yes go to farm 
- If you say you're a socialist you get demonised 
	- everything wrong with Britain today 
	- These young men aren't men 
	- death penalty for those against conscription!!!????
- creation of an enemy within because Germans could be up to something 


Bog standard industrial strikes 
War boom happens - Build more ships and things so more workers so housing and things go out of whack so rent strikes happen and then the government go AAGGHHHH Germans but it isn't its poor organisation 

Italian front sees some success of flyers being flown over the trenches in hot air balloons 
- basically says come be recruited

[[why did Tsars regime collapse]]
