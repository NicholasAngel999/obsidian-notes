# types of warfare such as battle of Somme and Verdun

stereotypical battles 
- last for month's
- thousands die 
- front line doesn't move much 

*both sides are using strategy of attrition 
- strategy of manoeuvre no longer possible 
- wear the opponent down until they must give up 
- nobody wants to admit the strategy of attrition 
you do this because you believe you have more resources than them


by the time of 1916 they want a different strategy but they've done that before didn't work and so will have to grind out a win 

# Verdun
42 German divisions - 340K casualties 
66 French divisions - 360k casualties 


Frances most powerful fortress due to position 

Schlieffen plan says French should leave fortress but he betrays and stays put
	French commander becomes national hero 


Germans get intel French are getting war weary 
- Germans logic is French is democratic 
	- doesn't have same discipline so significant losses on its army will result in home front collapse 


Petain uses the road into Verdun like a railway with the use of motor vehicles 
- voie sacree

counter attacks late spring 
- sort of what the Germans wanted/planned 

French fortresses built far better than the Belgian ones 

Germans focus on taking fort Vaux near duaomant but smaller

the only thing to stop the French and wave the white flag is the depletion of water. They just be thirsty


# Italian front 
not much happens 

Austrians attacking Italians who are on the mountains


# Battle of the Somme

55 Brits 420k casualties 



## reading 
victory through coalition Britain and France 

*what does battle of Somme tell us about allied conduct*
