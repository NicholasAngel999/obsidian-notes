How and why did North Korea become a communist state by the end of the 1940s? To what extent was this similar / different from other countries that became communist around this time, such as in Europe? How important was the Korean War in shaping the early days of the regime? Can you identify an anti-colonial narrative in North Korea’s early development? 
 

When the DPRK (N. Korea) was set up in 1948 after 3 years of Soviet Military occupation, it bore the hallmarks of a Soviet Satellite, such as a workers party closely aligned to the USSR and a large quantity of pro USSR leaders (p441) 
The cult of personality of Kim Il Sing was stronger than even that of Mao and Stalin, expanding to include his family members with him at the centre (p441) 
Once the Soviets decided to stay, General Shtykov headed up the Soviet Central Administration in Pyeongyang as a central administrative body. This was followed by the establishment of the Five-Province-Administration, which had 10 departments, all aided by Soviet advisors (p442) 
In October 1945, Korean communists who had come out of hiding created the North Korean Buro of the Korean Communist Party with support from the USSR (pp442-443) 
A day after the conference, Kim Il Sung made his first ever public appearance alongside the conservative nationalist leader, Cho Mansik (p444) 
 In 1946 all of the North Korean communist parties merged into the North Korean Workers Party, and became the Korean Workers Party in 1949 after merging with the South Korean Workers Party (p445) 
In theory, the North Korean Workers Party was a collation of many parties, including Protistant Chirstian's and the nationalist party of Cho Mansik (p445) 
Resistance to the Soviet occupation and the rising communist state met its peak during the end of 1945 and the start of 1946, with violence erupting in the streets (p445) 
Cho Mansik never liked the interference of the USSR in Korea, and after the USSR and the USA agreed to ’trusteeship’ of their halves of Korea respectively he never worked with the Soviets. He was arrested in January 1946 [during the riots] and replaced with Kim Il Sing’s friend Ch’oe Yonggôn (who died at the start of the Korean War). This ended the power of the upper class and resistance to communism in an organised way as the rich fled south (pp445-446) 
In 1946, the somewhat government of the People’s Provisional Committee meet and was full of communists. They began a redistribution of wealth and land, gender equality, new labour regulations announced a plan for economic industrialisation for 1947 (p446) 
As part of this a system called songbun formed, marking everything from religious background, class, and political belief. This system allocated what you got in the new system, your educational opportunities and where you lived. This would eventually become generational (p446) [effectively a cast system]  
I'm 1947 the trusteeship of the USSR and the USA broke down as each suspected the other. The future of Korea was handed over to the UN, who announced elections, which the North said were unfair as they back US interests and excluded the communists. In 1948, Syngman Rhee was elected as the leader of Korea, but the North elected Kim Il Sung as the leader of the DPRK (pp446-447) 
In July 1950 North Korea invaded the South. Kim had gotten both Mao and Stalin on side, with Stalin promising support to ’liberate’ the south so long as the war ended quickly before the USA had time to intervene (p447) 
Within 3 days the Koreans had taken Seoul, and by August the whole of the South was taken bear the Pusan Perimiter (p447) 
In mid September US General McArthur landed near Seoul and retook it under the flag of the UN, and began to push the Koreans towards the Chinese border. It was at that point China attacked and pushed the UN Coalition back to the 38th parallel (pp447-448) 
The north was devistated by the war. The US Airforce had practically levelled Korea, destroying cities and factories, eliminating economic output. The US used napalm and considered using nuclear bombs in 1951. The US went as far to destroy hydroelectric  plants and dams to cause mass flooding (p448) 
The war, however, only rooted the communists in deep in North Korea. The party was rebuilt with Kim Il Sing stronger than ever, mass lines of anti-Americanism were pushed and opponents fled south if they hadn't already done so during the war (p448) 
The party also experienced internal purges to remove the anti Kim faction. One of these was Hô Kai, who ordered the expellment and purge of those who collaborated with occupation forces. Kim saw the party, however, as somthing to encapsulate all, so reinstated those Hô removed and purged him in August 1953 (pp448-449)
