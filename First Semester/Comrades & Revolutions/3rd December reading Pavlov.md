Blames the coup for disolving the USSR, rather than the reformer Gorbachev 
15th August 1991 was a holiday mood, but there was increasing instibility, with many of the countries of the USSR seeing a rise in nationalism 
Gorbechev went on hoilday, leaving others in charge. Valentin Pavlov saw Gorbachev had made a new Union Treaty that many beleived would end the USSR. Pavlov wanted to change the Union Treaty to keep the union together, but Grbechev didn’t retun from holiday or respond 
Gorbechev hoped that the new Union Treaty would be a treaty to keep the rising nationalism of the union nations at bay 
Boris Yeltsin had set Gorbechev against the rest of the communist party by making Gorbechev beleive they must be fired after the Union Treaty was passed 
The calls to the eople that normally sparked support for the USSR and a sort of communist linked nationalism were no longer working  
At home the popularity of Gorbechev had collapsed. The communist hardliners beleived he had ruined the country, democrats that had handnt gone far enough. For the normal people economic hardship war rife, and for the non-Russian republics nationalism was rising  
By 1991 the army had already been sent not to the Eastern Bloc but within the USSR itself to keep order 
The Premier of Russia within the USSR, Boris Yeltsin, began attacking Gorbechev himself, deamnding the freedom of Russia from the USSR 
Baklanov swayed others and decided to prevent the signing of the Union Treaty and went to find Gorbechev to prevent it. They also wanted him to sign a State of Emergancy  
Kryuchkov beleived that Gorbechev knew the USSR was going to collapse 
Boldin said that when they went to Gorbechev they dind’t want to take power, but then said that they would work without his sanction if he reffused  
‘We wern’t arriving like some kind of bandits or anything’ ‘those were events, not a putsch’- Baklanov  
The phones in Gorbachev's holiday home were all dead upon the arrival of the plotters 
Gorbachev immediately feared being toppled like Khruschev, especially when he saw that every major leader of the USSR was there 
The plotters wanted Gorbachev to return to Moscow, but he reffused complaining about back problems. With his reffusal to travel they wanted him to declare a State of Emergancy, but he reffused saying he ‘didn’t want to get invovled’ and that it was an ‘overreaction’  
Gorbachev hoped the plotters would act against Yeltsin  
Gorbachev told the plotters ‘to hell with you, act as you see necessary’  
The plotters had cut Gorbachev off from the rest of the world 
Another story was that the group demanded him to sign the decree for a state of emergancy or resign.  
Pavlov justified saying Gorbachev was to ill to proeform his duties was by saying the only other way of getting around him was by saying he was a traitor 
The plotters tried to get Lukianov to sign the State of Emergency but failed, but he did say that the Union Treaty was Unconstitutional. He also said that Yanaev as vice-president was technically in power, and thus he singed the State of Emergancy 
Yanaev singed the State of Emergency, cenorship was installed, all parties other than the Communists were banned  
Pavlov ‘we didn’t want any bloodshed’  
Pavlov wanted a meeting with Yeltsin, where the idea of him as President of the USSR would be floated to keep him under control, but it never happened 
The morning TV was replaced with Swan Lake, the preprogramed TV for the death of the leader 
Khasbulantov told Yeltsin what was happening when he saw Swan Lake and the State Emergancy. They palnned to oppose what was happening. Yeltin went to the middle of Msocow, and along his rout he saw that the army was already being brought in, and he beleived that a coup was underway  
The sight of tanks in Mosocow saw panic, as it appeared the old methods of communist control was back, and the era of Perestroika and Glasnost were over 
Despite the tanks, everything went on like normal, and despite the State of Emergency all communications were competly open  
Yenaev told Yeltsin it was all his fault for the State of Emergancy for the rise of nationalism in Russia itself. This compeltly broke any attempt to bring Yeltsin on board 
Yeltsin went out to the people of the USSR to attack the plotters. He asked the people to answer to him as the elected leader of Russia, and threatened arrests to whoever listened to the ‘illegal’ USSR 
Yeltsin supportes began to baricade the ‘White House’ to keep him safe as time went on 
Gorbechave likly could have talked to the outside though a fax machine that was kept open and the satalite phones in his cars, yet he focused on getting the phones back up. Gorbachev asked the KGB to turn the phones back on, but this failed and he was told he could come to Moscow. Gorbachev would then use his son in laws video camera to record a tape for the world to see denouncing the coup  
At ‘the white house’ rifles and bullits were being handed out and petrol bombs were being made, wilst Yeltsin was receaving support from Western Leaders across the world and was even receving pressure to decare the independance of Russia 
For the plotters, it began clear the only way to get rid of Yeltsin was through force, so they called the elite KGB units to disperse the protestors, but the chairmas decided to hold off 
Rumors around the White House spread of an impending attack as tanks circled, and the soldiers there took the side of the democrats as they spread guns. Outside the protestors began attacking the army and KGB 
The decision was taken to withdraw the troops due to 3 deaths that had occured and lack of support 
The sign of the Red Army withdrawing from the White House was a signal that Russian nationalism had beaten Soviet communism  
Yeltsin and the coup group both now raced to Gorbachev and the phones were restored. Gorbachev reffused to meet the emrgancy comittee but agreed to meet with Yeltsin anf flew back to Moscow where the emergancy committee were arrested and one committed suicide  
However, even now Gorbachev failed to realise what had occured and the rise of Russian nationalism 
Yeltsin also blamed Gorbachev for the events of the coup  
When Gorbachev went to the Russian Parliament, he stood for all the world to see as a defendant with Yeltsin as prosecutor 
Yeltsin then signed a decree banning the Communist Party in Russia, directly challenging the power of Gorbachev  
The end of the USSR had ‘nothing to do’ with freeing the people, but rather with his own power 
Gorbachev resgined 24 hrs later as head of the Communist Party and recommended that the party disolve itself  
In just 7 days, 74 years of communist power had crumbled, and within months the Soviet Republics declared independence, with the Red Flag lowered for the last time on Christmas Day
