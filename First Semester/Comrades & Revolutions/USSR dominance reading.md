This session's suggested set reading is by Dan Stone, chapter 4 from his book Goodbye to All That: A History of Europe Since 1945, titled 'Catching UP: Eastern Europe: 1953 - 1975'. There is a link to the eBook on the module's reading list. 
How did the USSR assert its dominance over the rest of the Eastern Bloc? What were the Cominform, Comecon, Warsaw Pact? Were all communist countries in eastern Europe controlled by the USSR? What was life like in central and eastern European communist states? How would you characterise European communism? What do you think cultural and social experiences were like in these countries after 1945? How did they differ culturally and socially?

Most countries not directly controlled by the USSR where puppet governments or allies, who would often become puppet like if anti-communist elements ever tried to depose them. European communism at the time is depicted very much as weak as many countries leadership struggle to maintain power, and distrust was rampant within the Warsaw pact. The general consensus of people socially at the time, was that they had
