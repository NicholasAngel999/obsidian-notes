This is mainly down to the reading available 

### Revolutions and social and political unrest 
- this would be broken down into economic reasons, social reasons and political reasons all that lead to revolution 
- how they treated the revolution in its build up and in its peak 
- and how they deal with the revolution once it has passed and how the revolution had affected the country in the longer term 
### Economic factors 
- this would focus mostly on the political running of the country, how this may have led to unrest and how the people in the country lived 
- this would then have obvious ties to both other sections 
	- should then possibly be first 

### world effect and their spread of communism 
- again their world standing in terms of economic power 
	- as well as militaristic 
- did they attempt to spread communist influence 
	- how did they do this 
	- how effective was it 

#### relations with other communist states 
 and linking to world effect did they have relations to other communist states and how did that effect them as a state themselves

# reading list
- ### Introduction: Towards a global history of communism
	- *One of the contradictions in communism most frequently highlighted is that between the theory and the practice [page 21]
	- *there is no single theory of communism* [page 21]
	- *This theoretical diversity exists not only because so many individuals have contributed their ideas to the concept of communism, but also because of gaps, ambiguities, and even contradictions within the works of some of the best-known theorists.* [page 21]
	- *But Marx was vague about what would follow a socialist revolution. He maintained that, in the long term , a new type of society – communism – would emerge, in which there would be no ruling class and no alienation. Indeed, in this ultimate society, there would be no politics as such and no need for a state, which would ‘wither away’; the ‘government of persons’ would be replaced by the ‘administration of things’.* [page 24]
- ### Chapter 1: A German Prometheus **Germany
- 
- ### NEP and the future of the revolution **Russia
	- *Bolsheviks' victory in the Civil War brought them face to face with the country's internal problems of administrative chaos and economic devastation. The towns were hungry and half empty. Coal production had dropped catastrophically, the railways were breaking down, and industry was almost at a standstill.* [page 93]
	- *Deaths from famine and epidemics in 1921-22 would exceed the combined total casualties in the First World War and Civil War* [page 93]
	- *emigration of about two million persons during the years of revolution and war had removed much of Russia's educated elite* [page 93]
- 
- ### Stalinist socialism: Creating a country of metal, 1929-1939
	- *Industrialisation and collectivisation changed the USSR irrevocably* [225]
	- *particular features of the Stalinist economic model emerged out of complex and shifting socio-political atmosphere* [226]
	- 
- ### Russia in revolution : an empire in crisis, 1890 to 1928 , First edition.
	- _29 October the anti-Bolshevik executive of the railways workers' union threatened to call a strike unless talk to form a pan socialist government got under way. Leading Bolsheviks, led by Kamenev, insisted that the party negotiate in good faith, but Lenin threatened to 'go to the sailors' to scupper what he considered to be a bid on the part of right-wing socialists to play for time_ [page 152]
	- Right SRs in Petrograd and Moscow fighting to overthrow new regime [page 152]
	- _Bolshevik V.P. Nogin put it that **we consider a purely Bolshevik government has no choice but to maintain itself by political terror**_ [page 152]
	- _In the end, the Bolsheviks did form a coalition government_ [page 153]

_2,000 word essay_
***due 13th of December

#### Introduction 
Comparing two communist states can pose some issues such as what we decide to compare as well as how we quantify the "success" of a communist state. We can see a states success as how long the communist party ran for, how prosperous the country was, how true to their original aims they stayed or many more ways of defining success. In this essay I aim to examine both these different forms of success and the way the East German and Russian communist states in regards to: their relation to other communist states, the effect they had on the spread of communism, the success of their economy and revolutions and social/political unrest. [explain the east German and Russian views of communism]
