- In November 1918, in the face of widespread disorders, the national council in Zagreb had given a promise of land reform which was confirmed in the first public declaration of policy by the regent, Prince Alexander, who insisted that, ‘In our free state there can and will be only free landowners.’
- 
-	Malenkov became increasingly alarmed by the destabilising consequences of de-Stalinisation
-	Feared criticisms of the regime would be bolstered
-	He also feared Khrushchevs policies
o	Promotion of consumerism 
o	Economic decentralisation 
o	Peacful co-existence with capitalists
-	Lead to the creation of the ‘Anti-Party’ group, trying to unseat Krushchev
-	Krushchev fended them off
-	His imprint on Soviet era economics was less permanent

‘Another short-lived period of collective leadership followed Khrushchev's fall’. (p139) 

‘Soviet. Like his predecessors, Brezhnev, the Party leader, rose to become the dominant figure, albeit with considerable constraints on his personal power.’(p139) 

‘Till the late 1970s the command economy, in-built inefficiencies notwithstanding, retained sufficient dynamism to enable Brezhnev to preside over what Cohen has called the golden age of Soviet consumerism’. P139 

Soviet nuclear capability rose toroughly the same level as the USA (p139) 

The prices for produce and peasent farmer incomes were both raised, and retain prices reamined fix to prevent another Novocherkassk (p139) (A Red Army/ KGB massacre of peacfully striking workers after wages were cut 30-35% and quotas were raised) 

25% of State invesetment went to agruculture (pp139-140) 

However, infostructure was neglected through the USSR, causing unreliable electricity supply and causing degradation of roads and buildings (p140) 

The countryside remained a backwater of the USSR and there was a labour shorted as young people left to find work in cities, as urban poplations increased from 100,000 to 20 million between 1960-1980 (p140) 

Many rural areas saw an increase in the standard of living (p140) 

Outside of Moscow, there were still major supply issues. Basic food stuffs were short in cities such as St Petersburg (Leningrad), and basic goods like clothes and toothbrushes were also not to be found (pp140-141) 

Stalinist structures of economic planning were still in pleace despite issues. Everything was sacrificed to meet quotas, inovation was cut, industries would undersell themselves in order to meet targets they could easily make, labour and resources no matter how scarce was horded to make sure that targets could be made (p141) 

Brezhnev ended the Sovnarkhoz system, which decentralised the soviet control of the economy, reverting it back to Stalinism 

The prauge spring attempted to liberalised Russia and introduce some elements of capitalism to creat a socalist market.  

When he tried to reorganise the market, he found his efforts thwarted by a group of powerful cliques who had effectivly taken over the running of local managment  

He continued Krushchev’s consumerist and wealthfare system  

Communists of local minorities (e.g Baltics) were appointed to lead their local areas under the close and watchful eye of Russia. This was in order to prevent nationalist opposition. This objective was firthered by having native groups enter universities and meet quotas of academics produced from them, the hope being that their upward mobility would make them graeful to the USSR



### Similarities:

1. **Soviet Influence**: Both countries fell under the Soviet sphere of influence after World War II1. The USSR played a significant role in establishing communist governments in both regions1.
    
2. **Post-War Context**: The devastation of World War II created a power vacuum and economic instability, which the communists exploited to gain support12.
    
3. **Subversion of Multi-Party Politics**: In both countries, the communists gradually undermined and eliminated other political parties, ensuring their dominance2.
    

### Differences:

1. **Timeline**: The communist takeover in East Germany happened almost immediately after the war in 1945, while in Czechoslovakia, it took until 19482.
    
2. **Methods**: In East Germany, the Soviet military administration directly installed a communist regime2. In Czechoslovakia, the communists used a combination of political maneuvering, strikes, and protests to force the existing government to accept communist dominance3.
    

### Impact of World War II:

- **Czechoslovakia**: The country suffered significant destruction and loss of life during the war4. The post-war period saw a complex political landscape with a strong communist presence3. The communists capitalized on the economic crisis and the withdrawal of Western support to gain power3.
    
- **East Germany**: The war left East Germany in ruins, and the Soviet occupation facilitated the establishment of a communist regime2. The division of Germany into occupation zones also played a crucial role in the communist takeover1.
    

### USSR Influence:

The USSR exerted influence through direct military presence, political pressure, and economic control1. Stalin's strategy was to create a buffer zone of communist states to protect the Soviet Union from potential Western aggression1.

### Actions by Local Communists:

Local communists in both countries used a variety of tactics to ensure their dominance:

- **Political Alliances**: Initially, they formed coalitions with other leftist parties3.
    
- **Economic Manipulation**: They organized strikes and protests to destabilize the economy and blame other political forces3.
    
- **Intimidation and Violence**: They used the secret police and other means to suppress opposition2.
    
- **Rigged Elections**: In Czechoslovakia, the communists eventually forced the other coalition parties out of the government and held rigged elections to solidify their power3.



Comrades! The cult of the individual acquired such monstrous size chiefly because Stalin himself supported the glorification of his own person. The edition of his short biography, which was published in 1948, is an expression of the most dissolute flattery, approved and edited by Stalin personally. He marked the very places where he thought that the praise of his services was insufficient.

Comrades! The cult of the individual brought about rude violation of party democracy, sterile administration, deviations of all sorts, cover-ups of shortcomings, and varnishings of reality.

We consider that Stalin was extolled to excess. However, in the past Stalin undoubtedly performed great services to t
