Czechoslovakia and East Germany / The GDR
This session's suggested set reading is by R. J. Crampton, chapter thirteen from his book Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century and After, titled ‘The Communist Takeovers'. There is a link to an electronic version of this book on the module's reading list. 
Each workgroup needs to focus on the rise of communism after 1945 in the following countries: 211-239

Czechs and East Germans:
-	Limited Red Army occupation in Czechoslovakia when communist power had become established
-	Germany
o	The communists in Eastern Germany (unlike other communist countries) where ruled directly by their Soviet allies
o	Economy burdened by reparations paid to the USSR
o	July 1945 the Red Army established the SMAD (The Soviet Military Administration in Germany) including eleven centralised departments of government.
	Five of those departments, including those of the interior were headed by communists
	In the same month these four departments allowed the founding of four anti-fascist, republican and democratic political parties
•	Communist Party of Germany (KPD)
•	The Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD)
•	The Christian Democratic Union (CDU) 
•	The Liberal Democratic Party of Germany (LPD)
•	All four became members of the ‘Anti-Fascist Democratic Front’
•	No anti-communist coalition or party (at least recognised)
	Finally, in July 45, A united trade union organisation and a new youth movement were also established
o	KPD initially moderates, avoiding Marx or Engels, proletariat dictatorship or agrarian collectivisation. Designed to ease the Germans into socialism through redistribution of large estates, industrial nationalisation for the commanding heights of the economy
o	The KDP was favoured by the Soviets due to its good track record in Anti-Nazi resistance
o	Communist’s became the head of many major industries, KDP became head of Police
-	Czechoslovakia
o	The Czechs had a strong democratic record with multiple national components and two distinct nationalities who both had different levels of resistance during the war
o	After December 1945 no Soviet troops remained in the territory, the exiled head of state had signed a treaty of friendship with the USSR
o	Economic policy encouraged enterprise
o	A formation of anti-fascist parties came about
o	A national front was formed
o	The communists owned the ministry of the interior, defence, agriculture, education and information
o	Thirteen of twenty-six ministers where communists, twelve non-communist one neutral
o	They avoided an immediate seizure of power as they didn’t want people to rally behind an anti-communist banner
o	The Czech communist party organised a special division to infiltrate other parties, particularly the Czech National Socialists, and convert as many people as possible
o	12th February 1948, Non-Communist ministers demanded that communist packing of the provincial police be ended
o	The minister of the interior ignored it, the Communists then began mobilising support in the trade unions and other groups, to join action committees, in which they became armed
o	Various non-communist ministers resigned hoping to force a new administration excluding the communists
o	Instead the minister of the interior, due to the thousands of armed trade unionists parading through Prague, he tarried.
