In 1972, despite Mao visibly ageing, the question of his succession and the future of Chia had not yet been addressed (p94) 
Only five members of the Standing Committee of the Politburo of May 1969 remained, with leading figures such as Lin Biao dead 
One surviving member was Zhou Enlai, who served as country premier and masterminded the Nixon visit in 1972. However, in 1972 he knew he had cancer and by 1973 he was in hospital for much of the time (p94) 
A further important figure is Deng Xiaoping, vice premier and vice-chairman of the party and chief of staff to the arm. (p95) 
The leading radicals still alive who wanted to continue Mao’s legacy were his wife, Jiang Qing, and her two associates, Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyan, all of whom were appointed to the Standing Committee in 1973, excluding Zhang who went to the Politburo. Another figure to be appointed was Wang Hongwen, a protégé of Jiang Qing, who became second vice chairman of the party. Together they would make the vilified ‘gang of four’(pp94-95) 
More moderate members of the party, led by Zhou, pressed ahead mainly with economic development, with a Chinese Five Year Plan moving away from a Maoist focus on orality and civic duty towards a rewards-based system, however any actual economic development was mixed. In 1974 a slow rise in economic prosperity saw it drop to almost zero, and took a year to recover from. And grain growth in 1972 was poor due to bad weather (p95) 
The radicals/ gang of four, however, had a greater grasp over the propaganda engine of China. They used their plan to ‘Criticize Confucius’ to use Confucian Analects (quotes) to criticize the 12th century statesman Duke Zhou, the pun being the link to Zhou Enlai. This was later increased as well to even criticize Lin Biao. They were, however, ordered by the Politburo to stop, and move from a propaganda focus on the revolution to a focus on production (p95) 
Deng would eventually align himself with the ‘Four Modernizations’ plan, aiming at improving agriculture, national defense, industry, and science. This in most eyes aligned him to Zhou, but he did receive mixed support from Mao himself (p95) 
When Zhou died on the 8th January 1976, Mao feared he had to take action to prevent Deng from becoming all powerful in China and potentially reversing the Cultural Revolution and gave his support to Hua and he became acting premier. (p96) 
However, Hua appointment antagonised radicals such as Zhang, and the radicals also began moving to downpaly Zhou’s funeral by not annoncing whwre his funeral would be and cracking down on student protest. The Quingming festival for hounoring the ancestors (modified by the communists for honouring the revolutionary dead) saw mass public sentiment spill out howeve,r resulting in demonstrations at Trainman Square 
The demonstrations were mainly against members of the gang of four, but soon enough they even reached Mao, under the sudonym of a despotic ruler of Qing China (p96) 
The blame for the demonstrations was placed squalrly o the shoulders of Deng, who was forced out of his posiitons and Bejing (p97) 
However, all changed after the 9th September 1976 when Mao died (p97) 
Hua ordered the arrest of the other mubers of the gang of four and Mao’s widow, under charges that they were planning a coup and saw their support eveporate (p98)
