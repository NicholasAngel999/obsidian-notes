Vietnamese Communism began out of the search for international allies in support of independence from French colonial rule (p414) 
When the West rebuffed Ho Chi Minh in 1919 at the Treaty of Versaills he went to Moscow (p414) 
By 1932 there was a growing struggle in Vietnam for how much influence foreign powers should have in national politics (p414) 
Ho Chi Minh was used by the Vietnamese Communist Party (VCP) as a facade of unity based on him as founder and guide, which forced internal political disagreements to be buried under the surface (p414) 
The VCP waned to crush Western Imperialism and to eliminate class distinctions (p414) 
In 1941 Ho Chi Minh established the Veit Minh coalition, believing that WWII created the opportune moment to oust the colonial French (p415) 
Before this, the Indochine Communist Party (ICP) was established in 1930 in British Hong Kong. Ho Chi Minh recruited members from China to join the party and he along with the ICP worked together with the Comintern until his arrest in 1931. After his release he rejoined the Comintern in 1934 and went to Europe to study and teach, but was deeply out of touch with the younger generation of leaders (p415) 
The ICP leadership had been ‘restored’ in the late 1930s by those who returned from Moscow under the guise of Comintern education, but by 1940 their numbers had dwindled as many members were imprisoned, executed, or killed after two failed uprisings in 1940. (p413) 
When the French handed their colony of Indochine to Japan in 1940 saw many Vietnamese celabrate, but their expectations of indpendance soon dwindled as the Japanise set their own colonial establishments (p146) 
Some Communists in the South (mainly Trotskyists with whom the broader party had cut off relations in 1937) joined the Japanese, but many in the North formed an allience with the Chinese Communists and the Chinses nationalist Guomindang to fight the Japanise (p416) 
Towards the end of 1940 Ho Chi Minh, having been in Europe, came to Vietnam with the promise of foreign aide to the stuggeling ICP. His timing at a time of disorder meant that much of his autority within the party was restored, but many saw his nationalism as bourgeois and belived he had been in Europe too long (p416) 
The meeting of the Veit Minh in 1941 saw Ho Chi Minh call for the need to drop solgans of class strugle and instead focus on anti-French Imperialism and anti-Japanese incursion (pp416-417) 
The ICP then organised the Viet Minh into a fighting force in line to what China had been asking them to do in order to create a united front of anti-fascism. The arrival of the acting party chairman Truong Chinh and his acceptance of Ho Chi Minh and the Comintern’s authority saw the party unite and an end to the issues plaguing it (p417) 
As the war went on there were tense relations. Southern Trotskyists claimed that the North were simply Stalinists and mostly reffused to take part in the Guomindang training camps for guerilla warfare. Relations with the Guomindang was also tense, and Ho Chi Minh was arrested by them in 1942, accused of being a spy, and was only relased in 1944. (p417) 
After his realse Ho Chi Minh began to cultivate relations with the USA in Kunming, where the US Office of War Infomation was set up. Eventually he would begin talking with the US in setting up a joint anti-Japanise front (pp417-418)



**French colonial role pushed Vietnam to Communism 



Compatriots who love our country,

Why must we wage the Resistance war?

— Because if we do not wage the Resistance war, the French will occupy our country once more. They will enslave our people once more. They will force our people to be their coolies and soldiers, and to pay them every kind of taxes. They will suppress all our democratic freedoms. They will plunder all our land and property. They will terrorise and massacre our brothers, sisters, and relatives. They will burn down or destroy our houses, pagodas and temples. You will realise this by seeing what they have done in Hanoi and Haiphong.

— Because we do not want to be buffaloes and horses to the French, because we must protect our country, we must fight the French colonialists.

To fight we must carry out destruction. If we do not do so, the French will. If our houses are solid enough to be used as bases, they will mobilise tanks and vessels to attack us, and they will burn or plunder all our property. This is why we must carry out destruction before the French can make use of our property. Suppose we want to keep sluices, roads and houses for our own use, we can’t, because the French will occupy all or destroy all.

Now we must carry out destruction to stop them, to prevent them from advancing, and from using our roads and houses.

For the sake of the Fatherland we must make sacrifices and endure hardships for a certain time. When the Resistance comes out victorious, we will pool our forces for construction and repair work and this will not be difficult at all.

On the battlefront the fighters are sacrificing their lives for the Fatherland without regret; why do we regret a section of road, a sluice or a house which the French can use to attack our Fatherland?

You all love your country, no doubt you will have no heart to regret so.

Therefore, I earnestly call on you to exert all your efforts to carry out destruction work. We must destroy roads widely and deeply so that the French cannot use them. A pick stroke into the roads has the value of a bullet shot by our soldiers at the enemy.

I solemnly promise to you that after victory, I will endeavour to repair everything with you. We will build more beautiful roads, bridges and sluices and better houses worthy of a free and independent nation.

Long live our victorious Resistance war!

Long live independent Viet Nam!
