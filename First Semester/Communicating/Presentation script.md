Hello I am Cole Sumner and this is my presentation to show off your archive 

# Our Pitch 

Our display aims to raise the profile of the university, its archive and increase the use of the contents within the archive through a detailed display showing the history of the university 


# Target Audience 

Our target audiences are mostly students who are in and have access to the university and its assets. We would also like to focus on people who have an interest in history which is reflected in the times for our display 

# advertising 

Student association socials would be a great way of getting student interest especially with my links to the universities climbing club as well as links to the student union

we also plan on using the university TV boards, the university news letters and notice boards as well as targeted adverts to peak community interest

We do recognise the issues with flyers regarding littering which we plan to mitigate this by fixing them to lampposts for example or possibly in windows given the shop owners permission
