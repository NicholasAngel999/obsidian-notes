# times 
We are proposing that we run this display over 2 weeks with different times 
On the first week the display will be open on Tuesday for 4 hours between 2-6 pm with another display on Sunday between 3-7pm 
For the second week we would run one display on Friday again for 4 hours between 2-6 pm 
we have chosen these times specifically to attempt to have the most accessible display possible allowing as many students and people of the general public to explore. They start early enough to have maximum foot traffic through the university to get maximum interest as well as allow for people to finish classes or work and visit the display. The Sunday times are designed to have the majority of our open time after 4 because most businesses close from 4 which means people will be looking for something to do and so we provide them with that. 


# safety concerns 
There are a few safety concerns we have to consider 
The safety of the items is a key part of the display making sure they are protected in archive grade equipment. The items must be protected from damage, decay and even possible theft 

Firstly, considering the safety of the displayed items we must make sure they are both safe from decay and damage but also safe from any damage or even possible theft with measures such as containers or distance restrictions. 

To prevent litter, will also be providing litter bins and a storage area on entry to prevent food and drink being close to fragile items 

We must also consider providing enough space for our visitors to move around in to prevent over crowding  

In case of an emergency, we must make sure that the emergency exit remains unblocked, easy to access, and visible. Due to the nature of what would be on display, a water-based fire extinguisher would need to be provided


# mock banners 
The idea for the opening banner is to quickly show the history of the university through the images of its past as well as emphasise this with the use of both old and new ribbons for the title
vWe will then have more simplified banners with fewer images that will follow a simple theme. These boards will be our information boards with the aim of a more simplified design to make it easier for the readers to focus on and fully take in without distracting from the archives display.
