The uploaded article, "The English Homicide Act of 1957" by Graham Hughes, and the article "Swinging sixties the abolition of capital punishment" by Liz Homans, are **extremely helpful** for your case study, especially if you choose the UK case of Timothy Evans.

These sources provide the direct link between highly controversial executions, public unease, political compromise, and the eventual abolition of the death penalty.

## 🇬🇧 Specific Relevance for a UK Case Study

If you choose the case of **Timothy Evans**, these articles provide essential context:

### 1. The Catalyst: Irreversible Error

- The Hughes article explicitly mentions the key incident: a "wave of uneasiness through the British public" was sent by the executions of Bentley and Mrs. Ellis, **"together with the discovery that it was, to say the least, possible that Christie had committed a murder for which another man had earlier been hanged"**.
    
    - This "other man" is Timothy Evans, and this single sentence establishes the **wrongful execution** as a central factor in the public and political debate immediately preceding the Homicide Act of 1957.
        
    - The book you listed, _Dead woman walking_ (Ballinger, 2000), could provide detailed background on Mrs. Ellis's controversial execution, which, alongside the Evans/Christie discovery, created immense public pressure.
        

### 2. The Legislative Response: Homicide Act 1957

- The articles detail the **Homicide Act 1957**, which was the government's compromise response to the public pressure and the abolitionist movement led by Sydney Silverman.
    
- The Act itself, by restricting the death penalty to six categories of "capital murder," was an attempt to maintain capital punishment in only the most "heinous" cases and those thought to have a specific deterrent effect.
    
- The fact that the government was forced to introduce a "compromise bill" limiting capital punishment shows the significant political impact of the controversial cases, like Evans.
    

### 3. The Final Argument: Unworkable Compromise

- The Hughes article notes that the distinction between capital and non-capital murder was "irrational and muddled", and the Homans article confirms that the Act was an **"uncomfortable compromise"** that created "absurdities" and "anomalies".
    
    - The Home Secretary himself admitted in 1964 that the Homicide Act was **"unworkable in its present form"** and that the next Home Secretary "will have to end the death penalty".
        
- This is the key point for your case study: the system's inability to define a "just" category for execution (exposed by cases like Evans) led to an unworkable law, which then opened the door for **full abolition** in 1965.

## 🔎 Next Step

Since the resources you provided confirm the Evans case was a key driver in the political pressure to reform and eventually abolish the death penalty in the UK, I can now use the search tool to find specific factual information on his case to complete your outline.

I will search for details on Timothy Evans's conviction, the discovery of the real killer (John Christie), and his posthumous pardon.

I will use the following queries: This is excellent. The information from the UK abolition sources and the search results on the Timothy Evans case provide all the components you need for a compelling case study arguing against the death penalty based on wrongful conviction.

Here is a structured plan for your case study, integrating the key facts and arguments:

## 📝 Case Study: Timothy Evans (UK) – The Irreversible Error

### 1. Introduction: The Fatal Flaw

- **Thesis:** The execution of Timothy Evans for murders committed by a serial killer, John Christie, demonstrates the inherent and irreversible fallibility of the justice system, making the death penalty a morally and pragmatically unacceptable punishment.
    
- **Context:** Evans's execution, alongside that of Derek Bentley and Ruth Ellis, generated a "wave of uneasiness through the British public" about the operation of the death penalty. This led to political compromise and ultimately, abolition.
    

### 2. Case Summary and Conviction

- **The Setting and Crime:** Timothy Evans, a Welsh lorry driver, lived with his wife, Beryl, and infant daughter, Geraldine, in a flat at 10 Rillington Place, Notting Hill, London, with downstairs neighbour John Reginald Christie. Evans was convicted of the murder of his daughter, Geraldine, and hanged on March 9, 1950, at age 25.
    
- **Evidence for Conviction:** The prosecution relied on Evans's conflicting and retracted confession. Crucially, the prosecution's **star witness** was John Christie, who was described at the trial with "judicial approval" as a "perfectly innocent man".
    
- **The Role of Christie:** Christie, a serial killer, lived in the same house and murdered at least eight people. He had offered to perform an illegal abortion on Beryl, saying he would dispose of her body and find a couple to look after Geraldine.
    

### 3. The Discovery and Exoneration (The Irreversible Consequence)

- **The Truth Emerges (1953):** Three years after Evans's execution, John Christie was arrested. Police found the remains of several women hidden in the walls and floorboards of 10 Rillington Place. Christie confessed to killing Beryl Evans.
    
- **The Posthumous Pardon (1966):** Christie's confessions and subsequent conviction for his own wife's murder led the public to question Evans's guilt. After an initial inquiry upheld the conviction, a second, more thorough inquiry ultimately concluded that Christie was responsible for the murders of both Beryl and Geraldine.
    
    - Timothy Evans was granted a **posthumous Royal Pardon in October 1966**.
        
    - The High Court later acknowledged in 2004 that Evans did not murder his wife or daughter, **54 years after his wrongful execution**.
        

### 4. Argument Against the Death Penalty

- **Irreversibility:** The Evans case is the quintessential argument against capital punishment because his life could not be restored after the true killer was found. Evans was the victim of a "judicial murder," proving that even with Britain's legal "safeguards... a man was sent to his death for a murder he did not commit".
    
- **Flaw in the System:** The case highlighted the fallibility of the police and courts, as Christie, a multi-murderer, was relied upon as the chief prosecution witness.
    
- **Political Impact:** The case, along with other controversial executions (like Ruth Ellis), played a **major role** in the abolition of capital punishment in the UK in 1965. The subsequent Homicide Act of 1957, which attempted to limit capital punishment to certain categories, was a political "compromise".
    
- **The Tipping Point:** The Homicide Act's **"anomalies"** and demonstrable failings forced the Home Secretary to state in 1964 that the Act was "unworkable in its present form" and that the next Home Secretary "will have to end the death penalty". The fact that the system could not even define a reliable category for "capital murder" (a consequence of the errors exposed by cases like Evans) ultimately led to full abolition.
    

This structure allows you to use the specific tragedy of Timothy Evans's execution to support the broader argument that capital punishment must be abolished because the state cannot risk an irreversible error in a fallible justice system.
