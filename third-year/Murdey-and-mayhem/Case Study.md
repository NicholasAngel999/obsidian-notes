- **The Boyfriend:** Mary had been seeing a man named **Tom McGinty**, who she had met through her father and who was allegedly in the Merchant Navy.

## 🤔 Main Theories of the Case

### 1. Voluntary Disappearance / Elopement

- The most enduring theory is that Mary ran away to start a new life, possibly with Tom McGinty.
    
- **Supporting evidence:** She was seen frequently with him. In the 1950s, it was much easier for a 16-year-old to disappear and stay "off the radar" without modern CCTV, ID requirements, or easy communication.
    
- **Counterpoint:** Tom McGinty's existence has been difficult to confirm (the Merchant Navy had no record of him), and the original police files were reportedly lost in a flood, making details about his questioning unclear.
    

### 2. Pregnancy

- Another theory suggested by her family is that she was **pregnant** and ran away due to fear of her strict Catholic parents' reaction in 1959.
    
- **Counterpoint:** This is speculative and has no direct supporting evidence, though it provides a strong motive for a planned disappearance.
    

### 3. Foul Play

- Given her age and the suddenness of her vanishing, **abduction and murder** remain possibilities.
    
- **Supporting evidence:** Mary fits the profile of a young person susceptible to foul play. If this happened, it suggests the perpetrator was very skilled at disposing of a body, as she was never found.



## 1. Mary Flanagan's Background

- **Birth and Family:** Mary was born on June 9, 1943, into a Catholic family of Irish descent. Her family, including her parents and three younger siblings (sisters Eileen and Brenda, and brother Kevin), lived at **Wallace Road, E15, West Ham, London**.
    
- **Personality:** Her family described her as a **"confident young woman who knew her own mind"** and "outgoing and full of life," suggesting she was not easily pushed around, but possibly rebellious by the standards of the time.
    
- **Employment:** At 16, Mary was a working girl.
    
    - Her main job was at the large **Tate & Lyle sugar refinery** in Silvertown.
        
    - She also worked part-time for an optician in Stratford.
        
    - She volunteered with the Blind Association.

## 2. The Day of Disappearance (December 31, 1959)

### The Timeline:

- **Morning:** Mary overslept. She told her family she would still go to work that afternoon, intending to attend the New Year's Eve party held annually at the Tate & Lyle refinery.
    
- **1:00 PM:** She left the family home on Wallace Road.
    
- **Final Actions:** Her sister Brenda recalled that Mary went around and **kissed her younger siblings goodbye**, a gesture Brenda noted was unusual. Mary's mother and Brenda watched her walk towards **West Ham tube station**. Mary turned and waved before disappearing from view.
    
- **The Outcome:** Mary never returned home and never arrived at the New Year's Eve party.
    

### The Critical Pre-Disappearance Mystery

When Mary failed to return, her family contacted her employer. They were shocked to learn that Mary had **not been to work for approximately two weeks** before her disappearance, despite leaving the house every morning as if she were going to her job. This is the single most important detail suggesting the disappearance was planned or that she was keeping secret appointments in the lead-up to New Year's Eve.

## 3. The "Tom McGinty" Connection

- **The Alleged Boyfriend:** Mary had been seeing a man named **Tom McGinty**, an older fellow Irish immigrant who her father had introduced to her. He was reportedly a member of the **Merchant Navy**.
    
- **Engagement Rumor:** Some family members believed they were engaged, but Mary was never seen with a ring, and there was no formal announcement.
    
- **A Pre-Disappearance Fight:** A key detail emerged years later that Mary and Tom had a **"huge blow up fight"** at her house on December 30th (the day before she vanished). The fight was reportedly because Mary discovered he had lied about living with a landlady and was still living with his mother.
    
- **The Unverified Identity:** Police inquiries later found that the **Merchant Navy had no record of a man named Tom McGinty**. This makes it difficult to confirm his true identity or background.
    
- **Post-Search:** The man known as Tom McGinty actually **helped the family search** for Mary for a few months in early 1960 before falling out of touch.

## 4. Primary Theories for Her Disappearance

### A. Voluntary Disappearance / Elopement

- **Argument:** Mary may have intended to run away, perhaps with Tom McGinty, to escape her life or family's strictures. The fact she missed two weeks of work suggests she was preparing for or executing a planned departure.
    
- **Context of 1959:** In the pre-digital era, disappearing was significantly easier. Without bank records, mobile phones, or CCTV, a determined individual could successfully establish a new life under a new name with minimal friction.
    
- **Possible Sightings:** There were unconfirmed sightings, including one decades later in Scotland, which would support this theory. Police have also stated that if Mary were found alive and did not wish to contact her family, they would respect her wishes.
    

### B. Unwanted Pregnancy

- **Argument:** This is a strong potential motive. As a 16-year-old in a highly religious Catholic family in 1959, an unwanted pregnancy would have been considered a major scandal and a compelling reason for her to flee home in secret.
    

### C. Foul Play

- **Argument:** She was last seen walking toward a public transit station to attend a party. She may have encountered an opportunistic attacker or a killer, making the case an unsolved murder.
    
- **The Counter-Argument to Elopement:** If she had run away, especially in the hope of a better life, it is unusual that she never made contact with her family over the subsequent decades, or that no trace of her using an NI number or other official record has ever surfaced.

## 5. Challenges in the Investigation

- **Lost Files:** A significant hurdle for cold case reviews is that the **original police files were severely damaged or lost** due to a flood at Plaistow police station. This has hampered later attempts to verify initial witness statements and key details, such as the full report on Tom McGinty.
    
- **Lack of Technology:** In 1959, the police relied on simple methods:
    
    - Interviewing family and friends.
        
    - Putting up posters.
        
    - Roam the streets with her picture.
        
    - There was no DNA analysis, CCTV footage, satellite imagery, or social media for tracking leads.
        
- **Current Efforts:** The case is periodically reviewed, and police have issued **age-progression photographs** of what Mary might look like now, in the hope that she, or someone who knows her, will recognize her.
