# How to Write a Source Analysis  
*The following are the kind of questions you should ask of every extract, if they seem  
appropriate to you*
1. **What is the main issue or incident being referred to?  
2. Who or what institution said, wrote or produced the extract?  
3. **When was the extract produced, and where (if possible)?  
4. **To whom is the extract addressed? (Think about whether the intended  
audience affects the character or language of the communication.)  
5. With what purpose was the extract produced? (Was it to report, to  
persuade, to justify a position taken, or simply to record for instance?)  
6. **What effect did the extract have, if any?  
7. How can we assess the reliability of the source?  
8. **How does this source relate to the subject it is concerned with more  
widely? Why is it significant in its immediate context?  
9. How does this source relate to the general themes of this module? Why  
is it significant to considerations of crime and justice in the twentieth  
century?


### **1. What is the main issue or incident being referred to?**

The extract describes the **Chicago Memorial Day Massacre of 1937**, when police attacked striking steelworkers and their families outside the Republic Steel plant. It highlights the **excessive and indiscriminate police violence** used to suppress organised labour protests during the U.S. Great Depression.

### **2. Who or what institution said, wrote or produced the extract?**

The words come from **Mrs Lupe Marshall**, a civilian eyewitness and victim, speaking under oath to the **U.S. Senate’s La Follette Civil Liberties Committee**. The official transcript was produced and published by the Senate as part of its investigation into violations of workers’ rights.

---

### **3. When was the extract produced, and where (if possible)?**

Marshall gave this testimony in **1937**, shortly after the massacre, during hearings held in **Washington D.C.** The events she recounts occurred in **Chicago, Illinois**, on **30 May 1937**.

---

### **4. To whom is the extract addressed?**

Her statement was formally addressed to **Senator La Follette and fellow committee members**, but by extension it targeted the **American public and press** following the hearings. Knowing her words would enter the public record, Marshall framed her account in **moral and emotive language** aimed at persuading both legislators and citizens of the injustice she witnessed.

---

### **5. With what purpose was the extract produced?**

The purpose was **to bear witness and to persuade**—to provide credible, human evidence of state brutality so that the Committee could hold police and corporate actors accountable. It sought to **expose abuses of power**, vindicate the rights of unionised workers, and pressure for legal or political reform.

---

### **6. What effect did the extract have, if any?**

The testimony helped shape **public outrage** and contributed to growing criticism of police and corporate violence in the late 1930s. Although immediate prosecutions were rare, the hearings **strengthened federal awareness of civil-liberties violations** and supported the broader New Deal narrative that the state must protect—not crush—labour rights.

---

### **7. How can we assess the reliability of the source?**

It is a **first-hand, sworn account**, increasing factual reliability for what Marshall directly observed. However, its **subjectivity and emotional tone**—a victim recalling traumatic violence—mean it may exaggerate certain impressions or omit context. Cross-checking with film footage, press reports, and other witness statements confirms the **core accuracy** of her description, while reminding us of the **partial, experiential perspective** inherent in any eyewitness testimony.

---

### **8. How does this source relate to the subject it is concerned with more widely? Why is it significant in its immediate context?**

The extract embodies the **tensions between policing, class conflict, and civil rights** in Depression-era America. Immediately, it exposes how police functioned as an **instrument of corporate control** rather than neutral law enforcement. Its publication during an official inquiry gave visibility to working-class suffering and challenged prevailing notions of “law and order.”

---

### **9. How does this source relate to the general themes of this module? Why is it significant to considerations of crime and justice in the twentieth century?**

Marshall’s testimony reveals how **definitions of crime and justice are politically constructed**: the strikers were criminalised while state violence went unpunished. It illuminates key twentieth-century themes—**the legitimacy of policing, the criminalisation of dissent, and the relationship between power and justice**. The source thus demonstrates that policing is not merely about enforcing law but also about sustaining or contesting social order.
