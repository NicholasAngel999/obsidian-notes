# How to Write a Source Analysis  
*The following are the kind of questions you should ask of every extract, if they seem  
appropriate to you*
1. **What is the main issue or incident being referred to?  
2. Who or what institution said, wrote or produced the extract?  
3. **When was the extract produced, and where (if possible)?  
4. **To whom is the extract addressed? (Think about whether the intended  
audience affects the character or language of the communication.)  
5. With what purpose was the extract produced? (Was it to report, to  
persuade, to justify a position taken, or simply to record for instance?)  
6. **What effect did the extract have, if any?  
7. How can we assess the reliability of the source?  
8. **How does this source relate to the subject it is concerned with more  
widely? Why is it significant in its immediate context?  
9. How does this source relate to the general themes of this module? Why  
is it significant to considerations of crime and justice in the twentieth  
century?
