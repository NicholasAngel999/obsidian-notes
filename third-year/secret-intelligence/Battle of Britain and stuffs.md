How did British intelligence  
monitor and assess the  
threat of German invasion?

- From the invasion of Norway to the following autumn there had, indeed, been little outward sign that the intelligence system was becoming more efficient or that the operational authorities were ready to place greater confidence in its findings or its judgments.
    
- Intelligence bodies began to take steps towards improving their ability to acquire and understand intelligence so that they could make better use of said intelligence!
    
- The Military Co-Ordination committee of the cabinet on 12th April hastily made the war office’s intelligence branch responsible for meeting the urgent need for intelligence in the Scandinavian theatre  by issuing a daily summary while reviewing and revising how intelligence would be brought to the attention of the government during the campaign. JIC quickly took over this duty from the war office.
    

- They would arrange for special meetings of the Service intelligence departments, the SIS and only when needed the Foreign Office.
    

- 11 April Joint Planners had asked the JIC to hold an emergency meeting to consider the possibility of German invasion into the low countries.
    

- Joint Planners and relevant Chiefs of Staff then had JIC adopt the possibility of German intentions into their daily intelligence summaries.
    

- These changes were revisited when Churchill ordered the Chiefs of Staff to review the system for which intelligence was related to the governments operational decision making.
    

- The outcome of this enquiry was to confirm the JIC as the central body responsible for producing operational intelligence appreciations and for bringing them to the attention of the operational authorities
    
- The Chiefs of Staff strengthened the JIC's secretariat. The y directed the JIC to take the initiative in issuing, at any time of day or night, and only to the Prime Minister, the War Cabinet and the Chiefs of Staff, urgent papers on any strategic development on which any of its members wanted to report in the light of any information received from the Foreign Office or  
    the Service departments.
    
- The Chiefs of Staff emphasised the need to prepare papers rapidly to prevent action being taken on documents not thoroughly assessed
    

- These arrangements were adopted in response to GC and CS’s success in breaking the Engima used in Norway, these weren’t implemented however until after the invasion of France.
    
- The insistence that the JIC should make urgent strategic reports only to the Prime Minister, the War Cabinet and the Chiefs of Staff carried with it the implication that the other intelligence bodies, including the Foreign Office, should no  
    longer report separately to those authorities on these matters. For this  
    reason the JIC arranged on 24 May that the MEW, the SIS and MI5  
    should have full membership
    
- JIC was still reliant on separate government departments to provide intelligence as these in turn still depended on what they received from the inter-departmental bodies responsible for procuring intelligence.
    
- It was one thing to strengthen the JIC machinery, but quite another to secure a substantial improvement in the procurement of intelligence, in the standards which the departments brought to its evalu ation and in the promptness with which they brought their evaluations together for central assessment at the JIC
    
- In the second half of May, appalled by the paucity of topographica l information which had been brought to light in Norway, the Chiefs of Staff instructed the JIC to consider what measures could be taken to improve it in relation to possible future theatres of war
    
- The outcome was to introduce better arrangements for the inter-departmental collection, analysi and distribution of topographical data. The NID’s topographical department was expanded and given the mandate to provide intelligence to other departments
    
- JIC was responsible for indicating areas of planned British Operations and eliminating duplication between the different departments
    
- Thanks largely to the breaking of enigma regularly and currently thanks to the initial key found in Norwegian operations and then later in operations in France, meant operational intelligence wasn’t as slow in being gathered, but didn’t happen in time to assist the British in the Norwegian or French campaigns
    
- By 30 May MI t had formed tolerably accurate estimates of the  
    strengths of the German Army Groups A and B, of the transfers which  
    had taken place between them and of the reserve divisions immediately  
    available for further operations, and it recognised that these so  
    outnumbered the remaining French formations that Germany would  
    probably continue the offensive against France, using the threat of an  
    attack through Switzerland to force her to retain large forces on the  
    Upper Rhine while seeking her destruction further west

How did British intelligence affect the Battle of Britain?

- ‘One may draw the conclusion that the decisive factor in this war is not so much the weight of the material used, as a High Command who knows how to use it best’
    
- The Battle of Britain was something of a peculiarity in that combat occurred exclusively in the air and was fought by two tiny airborne military elites, albeit with extensive ground support apparatus. It was a struggle of attrition: if either side suffered unsustainable losses in pilots or planes it would be forced to suspend operations. If this fate were to befall  the RAF then Britain would be invaded, but if the Luftwaffe were rendered incapable of sustaining offensive operations, then the German invasion would be suspended.
    
- However accurate the ﬂow of information may be, it is useless without sufﬁcient force to exploit it. (Intelligence as a force multiplier)
    
- Britain is fresh from defeat on the continent, but fighter command was in a better position.
    
- Considerable investment was put into building a defensivesystem that would either halt incoming raids, or inﬂict so much damage thatthey became too costly to continue.
    
- As early as 1934 it invested£10,000 in tentative radar trails, and by experimenting with the efﬁciency of radio communications. By 1938 radar had achieved a status of considerable reliability.
    
- Coupled with more traditional methods of observation like spotter on the coast, Radar became the lynchpin of the air defence system.
    
- The intention was to detect incoming German attacks as early as possible, and then to direct RAF ﬁghter squadrons along an inter-ception route. However, the system was certainly not impregnable. It had been constructed with the expectation of a much lower volume of incoming attacks than proved the case in 1940.
    
- German use of French aerodromes so close to Britain could never have been foreseen in the planning stage, and granted the Luftwaffe a much more favourable staging ground. 51 Moreover, the use of radar in this way was without historical precedent, and only trial by combat could test the workings of the system
    
- The entire system functioned by generating a high level of situational aware-ness, and this demanded a constant ﬂow of accurate information regarding enemy moves. The British intelligence requirement was typical of any defensive structure
    
- By choosing to meet Luftwaffe raids head-on, Fighter Command had to be on the tactical offensive. Its pilots required the greatest possible warning time to respond efﬁciently. The Group Commanders required accurate data on the nature and scale of each raid so that they could prioritize incoming threats and dispatch the correct response
    
- Fighter Command was very much a ﬁnite resource that could not be expended in a single blaze of glory, or else Britain would be left open to invasion. On the subject of numbers, the contest for air superiority was roughly equal, with approximately 800 Luftwaffe single-engined ﬁghters facing the RAF’s700-plus ﬁghter force. This ﬁgure discounts bombers, dive-bombers and twin-engined ﬁghters, all of which lacked adequate dog ﬁghting capability
    
- However, the RAF had lost fully one-third of its experienced pilots over France and replacing these would be a painstakingly slow process
    
- Like any intricate system it would be some time until problems were ironed out and ideas perfected
    
- A relevant case in point was AI’s gross pre-war overestimation of German air power. By applying a worst-case logic to every variable, from aircraft production to bomb loads, AI concluded that 945 tons of bombs could be dropped in a 24-hour period, resulting in 50,000 civilian deaths
    
- After the dreaded German‘knockout’ blow against London failed to materialize in 1939, and after witnessing the evidence of early Blitzkrieg campaigns, these mistakes were eventually ironed out. The summer of 1940 is cited by the ofﬁcial history of British Intelligence in the Second World War as the point at which the system began to function far more efﬁciently. 61 The timing could not have been more fortunate. The fear that Hitler may strike the British Isles was evident throughout1940. The case was often overstated, with AI talking in February of ‘the overthrow of the British Empire, with the avoidance of a direct attack on France’.
    
- Once the Battle began, intelligence would clearly play a supporting role to the efforts of Fighter Command.
    
- Intelligence would nevertheless contribute in two vital areas. Firstly, it would provide information on the Luftwaffe order of battle. Secondly, it would provide forewarning of imminent Luftwaffe operations. 66 Examining each in turn will provide a good sense of the overall role played by intelligence in the British defence.
    
- The poor radio discipline exhibited by Luftwaffe aircrews allowed the British to intercept a vast amount of low-level chatter. This divulged the callsigns used to identify different German units, the numbers of aircraft being referred to, and perhaps even the bases they operated from.
    
- All this information was carefully cross-referenced with existing knowledge about Luftwaffe units, particularly from aircraft tail markings
    
- In July 1940 Luftwaffe strength was estimated to be 5,000 Frontline aircraft, half of which being bombers, with 7000 reserves.
    
- AI admitted that in addition to intercepted call signs, the other method it employed had been ‘estimations of output and wastage, based on an analogy with British experiences
    
- The ﬁgures were challenged by members of the Air Staff for being unrealistically large, and were recalculated to a more accurate 2,500 aircraft with the aid of extra intelligence garnered from Enigma.
    
- In short, fighter command thought it was facing a bigger enemy than it was in reality
    
- Forewarning of incoming raids was the second biggest asset, Radar especially being useful for this
    

- Height readings only approximate
    
- Time lag between interpreting radar and scrambling fighter squadrons averaged at four minutes – it took air raids six minutes to cross the channel
    

- Poor radio discipline often contributed to giving away the destination, size and timing of raids, by late summer these intercepts were fed to fighter stations of 11 Group within one minute of being heard.
    
- Low grade signit could only pick up tactical transmissions so what of enigma and the interception of high grade communications?
    
- Bletchley broke Luftwaffe enigma keys in January 1940!
    

- Enigma however provided no help in forecasting the shifts that occurred during the battle in the GAF’s Methods and objectives, discussions between commanders in Berlin and formations stationed in France were by landline
    

- The Air Intelligence Branch of the Air Ministry was organized on a geographical basis whereby all material relating to a particular country was dealt with by a particular sub-section. Thus, AI3b was the sub-section that dealt with all information relating to Germany, including order of battle, aircraft, training and production.
    
- The de facto disappearance of national frontiers in Europe and the increasing need to deal effectively with operational intelligence of the utmost urgency led directly to the abandonment of geographical divisions in the handling of intelligence in the war against Germany. Thus AI3b eventually became responsible for studying orders of battle and organization for all air forces in northern Europe, while other sub-sections performed similar roles for airfields, production and training
    
- These changes also reflected the shift in relative importance between Sigint and photographic reconnaissance on the one hand, and published and clandestine sources on the other.
