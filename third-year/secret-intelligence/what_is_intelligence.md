# What is intelligence 

intelligence = essentially doing things with information 

**foreign intelligence**
- fairly obvious
- not just during war time

  
**Military intelligence**
- for military acts
- aids operations

  
**Security intelligence**
- countering threats
-   espionage
-   terrorism
-   sabotage
-   subversion
- this is always happening and will not stop happening

***Its a Cycle***
Direction (hard Bait) - Collection (cool bit) - Analysis (geeky bit) - Dissemination (Boring bit) - back to direction 
Where is the danger     spies, break codes      Using collected data   getting information to those who need it - must be careful


collection | analysis | consumption

*Capability and Intent* 
- what are means of disposal - what do you have
- difficult to find out how they will use it
- sort of need both parts but intent is really important 

*Mirror-imaging* 
- analysts make the mistake of assuming the enemy has the same set of assumptions about the world as you
- made this mistake with hitler - hes thinking about jewish problem we see the economy impact it would have and belive that its stupid 

*indicators_and_warnings* 
- cant have warnings without intent
- cant be on high alert 24/7 so we need the indicators 

*signals_&_noise*
- these get in the way of indicators and warnings
- 

*secrets_&_mysteries*
- secret is something adversory has decided to do but doesnt want you to know - **IT IS KNOWABLE**
- mysteries are undecided or **UNKNOWABLE** because even they dont know




*HUMAN_INTELLIGENCE -- HUMINT*
- oldest form
- can be done overtly or covertly
- Money Ideology Compromise Ego
- Aldrich Ames - CIA became soviet spy because he liked the money

*SIGNALS INTELLIGENCE -- SIGINT*
- picking up messages

*IMAGERY_INTELLIGENCE -- IMINT*
- photo intelligence 

*OPEN_SOURCE*
- intelligence from what you can collect


all forms of intelligence require source protection 
*Human Intelligence*
- make sure the source of the intelligence is safe and isnt going to be removed
- need to keep number of collectors down to a minimum
- then we need to tell who needs to know - but they cant be allowed to find out who the source is 

*Sigint* 
- large array of people need to know
- potentially a lot of people need the information so who needs to know what level of detail
