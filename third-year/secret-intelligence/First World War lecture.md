**Jim Notes 27.10.2025**

- First World War (YIPPEE) 1 of 2 (YIPPEE!!!)
    
    - 1909-1919
        
- Today will be on security intelligence, which at this point everyone does (unlike foreign and military intelligence which is optional at this point, that’s next week)
    
- British Intelligence in 1909
    
    - Focus on counter-subversion and counter-espionage
        
    - When looking at the world before the secret service bureau, the MET Police Secret Service Branch is the dominant force in secret intelligence
        
        - Been going for 30 years
            
        - Conducting investigations and surveillance work
            
        - Big basis in Ireland, linguistically talented
            
        - Cooperating with the French when it comes to foreign anarchists
            
    - Each of the Colonies have a strong police intelligence presence to keep a lid on dissent and rebellious action
        
    - War office and the Admiralty
        
        - In both we have small amounts of intelligence staff
            
        - A dozen officers responsible for analysing (and before 1909 collecting) relevant intelligence for foreign military powers (primarily Germany)
            
        - Various attaches around the world, diplomatic representatives, typically Military officers, for Military discussions
            
        - Once a country becomes a potential threat, the goal of an Attache is to absorb overt information for the countries military and navel capabilities
            
        - They will also likely speak to other attaches to gather information
            
    - In relation to foreign intelligence, we have the Foreign office, who are starting to see the need for intelligence gathering, especially covert intelligence
        
    - The 1909 Moment
        
        - Popular Culture of this period
            
            - The Edwardien’s, become engrossed with spies
                
            - A sense that, especially after 1903, there is a growing spy fever in Britian
                
            - Riddle of the Sands, the prototype of most spy novels, this novel caught the attention of the general public
                
            - William Le Queux: Spies of the Kaiser, Plotting the Downfall of England
                
                - Scaremongering
                    
            - One that is almost as good as Riddle of the Sands which isn’t published until 1915 is John Buchan
                
        - This spy literature also ties in quite well with invasion literature ‘what if the enemy came’
            
        - Talks of national service begin
            
        - There is also the crescendo of the Navel Arms race
            
        - The Liberal Government is reluctantly dragged into spending more on the Military than they had planned, they wanted to spend on Welfare
            
        - 1908, you also have various reforms in the army, creation of the territorial force
            
            - Strong line of thought that this force was made to protect Britain in the result of War
                
        - Fear of the ‘Enemy within’ (German Migrants)
            
            - There was an idea that all these Young German men, with hidden armaments, are going to mobilise
                
        - What we also see in this period, is that William Le Queux meets an army officer, James Edmond, the man responsible for intelligence management , also became the Historian for British intelligence for the First World War
            
        - Le Queux, primarily looks to gain clout, he pushes nonsense to Edmond, who buys into that world view
            
    - Because the Germans are more security conscious and the attaches are struggling to gain the same sort of information, there is this sense that there needs to be a better system to prevent us from being surprised
        
    - So, they wish to create a Secret Service Bureau (SSB) to run it
        
        - Joint Office
            
        - Military rep – focused on defence
            
        - Navy rep – focused on German navy
            
        - Private detectives to do leg work
            
    - However, the way it actually works out, is the incompatibility of the army and navy rep, resulting in the splitting to different offices
        
    - The Army officer – Kell, assisted by William Melville and his detective agency
        
    - The Navy Officer – Mansfield Cumming
        
    - Key personalities
        
        - The Main Player – Basil Thomson, Assistant commissioner of the Met Police, in charge of special branch
            
            - He doesn’t come from a policing background, hes a well connected colonial governor
                
            - Connections to the press
                
        - Vernon Kell – The Junior Army Officer
            
            - Speaks multiple languages (logical choice for foreign intelligence, but for some reason is on the homefront)
                
            - Introverted but clever
                
        - Mansfield Cumming – Senier Naval Officer
            
            - Last few years of career
                
            - Friends with the head of navel intelligence
                
            - His Navel career was limited due to sea sickness
                
            - He’s very into tech, and fast cars
                
            - Does like dressing in disguises – social and extroverted.
                
- British Intelligence in 1914
    
    - War breaks out, suddenly, practically out of nowhere (due to a wrong turn)
        
    - The number of people doing intelligence is quite small for the scale that is now needed
        
    - MET police has around 100
        
    - Cummings around 10
        
    - Kell around 50
        
    - Few dozen on Analysis
        
    - One of the big things at the start of the war, you lose your attaches, as the embassy needs to be vacated and transported to a neutral country
        
        - There is an attempt to continue to use attaches in neutral countries, to keep wired in to diplomatic chit chat
            
    - Before Christmas 1914, the organisations begin to grow to match the task at hand
        
    - As new intelligence organisations begin to emerge, the numbers grow exponentially
        
    - The short war mentality of August 1914 damages short term arrangements, you don’t think the war will last long enough for anything meaningful to be done long term
        
    - Due to this idea of a short war, you plan an expeditionary force that contains all the intelligence personal of the British army, taking them to France, this is fine if the war will be over by Christmas, but its not
        
        - So you need to fill these desks, ready for these guys to come back
            
    - MPSB Officers enlisted as BEF intelligence Policeman, sent to France to provide security in the rear of the British army, but again, that deprives the special branch
        
    - Long and short of it, finite resources your throwing all into one place cause you expect a short war, the war goes on, and you now need to refill these positions
        
    - The basic elements
        
        - Special Branch – Continue doing their thing, replacing the guys volunteered to France
            
        - Army intelligence becomes MO5 (g), later as MI5, closely linked to the War Office and usage of postal censorship
            
        - A organisation MI1 (b) who are dedicated to breaking codes of cable traffic
            
        - GHQ intelligence, initially in France, the headquarters you have, all the good personal end up there, until expanding later
            
        - Home Forces begin establishing their own intelligence organisation
            
        - Admiralty Intelligence = Room 40 – Wireless intelligence, codebreaking
            
        - Secret Service, formerly the Navy Branch, cover name is MI1 (c), with out stations establishing across the world
            

  
  

- Security Intelligence
    
    - Spy fever will be something we read about
        
    - Most famous First World War spy
        
        - Mata Hari – a Dutch exotic dancer, doing risque erotic dances in Paris
            
        - She would do her performances (strip tease (WHEYYYY)) with private performances as well
            
        - She is executed for espionage by the French in 1917
            
        - Due to her pre-war profile she is quite well known, she becomes the image of a first world war female spy, seducing older influential men to entice secrets out of them
            
    - The most typical spy
        
        - German spies in Britian, unfortunately no exotic dancers
            
        - Karl Hans Lody is the most famous of them
            
        - We know quite a lot about German spies in Britian due to an accident of archival survival
            
            - The German navy are in charge of espionage against Britain, the army focusing elsewhere
                
            - In 1945, during a bombing raid, the Military archives in German burn up

            - Hundreds of middle-class to Upper-Middle Class women, who speak foreign languages, checking the mail
                
            - If you put something in a letter you shouldn’t, the letter will be returned to you, until whatever was of concern is removed, but now you’re on a watchlist, well done
                
            - They also start checking for writing in Invisible Ink
                
    - A lot of MI5 Work comes down to the fear of German spies and the fear of German spies being in the country
        
    - A general fear stoked by the hard right, certain incidents occur that heighten the tension
        
        - Sinking of the Lucitania
            
        - The Zeppelin Raids
