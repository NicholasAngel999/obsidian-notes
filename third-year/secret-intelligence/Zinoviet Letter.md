Based on the provided text, which comprises chapters from the biography _Churchill's Man of Mystery: Desmond Morton and the World of Intelligence_, here is a summary of the events involving Desmond Morton between 1927 and 1931.

### **I. The Macartney Espionage Case (1927–1928)**

The text details Morton's operational role in neutralizing a Soviet espionage ring targeting the Royal Air Force.

- **The Operation:** Morton handled an agent, George Monkland, to entrap Wilfred Macartney, a man attempting to sell information on British aircraft to the Comintern. Although Morton was initially suspicious that Monkland might be a Soviet plant or a blackmailer, he eventually trusted him for the operation.
    
- **The ARCOS Raid Connection:** Macartney claimed he had warned the Soviet trade delegation (ARCOS) of a police raid in May 1927 after receiving a tip from a Special Branch clerk. While Morton publicly dismissed this claim, Macartney’s foreknowledge suggested a potential security leak.
    
- **The Arrests:** The operation culminated in November 1927 when Monkland met a Soviet handler, "Mr. Johnson" (Georg Hansen), leading to the arrest of both Hansen and Macartney.
    
- **Outcome:** Both men were sentenced to ten years in prison under the Official Secrets Act in January 1928. For Morton and the SIS (Secret Intelligence Service), this was a successful conclusion to a long operation, although it failed to expose the higher-level Soviet paymasters.
    

### **II. Professional Crises and "Loose Ends" (1929–1931)**

Between 1929 and 1931, Morton and the SIS faced political pressure, internal scandals, and jurisdictional disputes.

- **The Zinoviev Letter Resurfaces:** In 1929, the arrest of forger Vladimir Orlov in Berlin caused anxiety for Morton and SIS Chief Hugh Sinclair, who feared new revelations regarding the controversial 1924 Zinoviev Letter. Morton traveled to Prague to gather information on Orlov to manage potential fallout, though no damaging exposures ultimately materialized.
    
- **Soviet Penetration of Special Branch:** A 1929 investigation into a spy ring run by W.N. Ewer revealed that two Special Branch officers were Soviet agents. A diary seized from the ring revealed that Soviet intelligence had maintained detailed surveillance on SIS personnel and headquarters for five years.
    
- **Conflict with Special Branch:** Morton ran a network of domestic agents known as "Casuals" to infiltrate Communist organizations, a role that overlapped with Scotland Yard's jurisdiction.
    
- **Maxwell Knight:** Morton recruited Maxwell Knight (later a famous MI5 officer) to infiltrate the Communist Party. This provoked a severe confrontation with Colonel Carter of Scotland Yard, who threatened to destroy Morton’s network.
    
- **Resolution:** To resolve these turf wars, a Secret Service Committee meeting in 1931 transferred responsibility for domestic counter-subversion—including Maxwell Knight and the "Casuals"—from SIS to MI5.
    

### **III. The Shift to Industrial Intelligence**

As his role in counter-espionage diminished, Morton pivoted toward economic and industrial intelligence, recognizing the growing threats of the Soviet Union and Germany.

- **Section VI:** Morton established Section VI (the Economic Section) within SIS to study "industrial mobilisation" and the German concept of _Wehrwirtschaft_ (defense economy).
    
- **Monitoring Threats:** This section monitored Soviet commercial espionage (the WAD) and gathered evidence of illegal German rearmament, which Morton identified as a threat earlier than many politicians.
    
- **Technological Interests:** Morton personally investigated foreign military technology, such as a trip to Czechoslovakia in 1929 to secure a new explosive known as "M/N" or "Marmalade".
    

### **IV. Creation of the Industrial Intelligence Centre (IIC)**

The British government lacked a coordinated body to assess foreign industrial war potential, leading to Morton's ascent as a key expert.

- **Systemic Failure:** The "FCI Committee" (Industrial Intelligence in Foreign Countries), established by the Committee of Imperial Defence, failed to function effectively due to a lack of expertise within the service ministries.
    
- **SIS Intervention:** Sir Edward Crowe of the Department of Overseas Trade approached SIS for help. Morton provided a detailed, authoritative report on Soviet industrial mobilization that impressed the committee.
    
- **A New Role:** As a result, the Industrial Intelligence Centre (IIC) was formed in 1931 with Morton as its Director. This position allowed Morton to break free from the restrictive framework of SIS and eventually share vital information regarding German rearmament with Winston Churchill.




## Zinoviet - Gill Bennett

Based on the provided chapters from _The Zinoviev Letter: The Conspiracy That Never Dies_ by Gill Bennett, here is a summary of the 1998 investigation into the Zinoviev Letter and the author’s conclusions regarding its authorship:

### **The 1998 Investigation and Historical Context**

Chapter 6 details the environment leading up to the Foreign Office’s 1998 inquiry into the Zinoviev Letter, commissioned by the incoming Labour government.

- **The Mandate:** In early 1998, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook commissioned a new investigation into the Zinoviev Letter, granting historians unrestricted access to all sources. Cook mandated that the report rely on all available evidence and be published in full.
    
- **Political Significance:** The Labour Party historically viewed the Zinoviev Letter as an example of MI5 interfering in politics to destroy a Labour government. During debates on the Security Service Bill in 1988, Labour MPs cited the letter as evidence of institutional bias against the trade union and labor movements.
    
- **Intelligence Transparency:** The investigation benefitted from a shift toward greater openness regarding British intelligence services during the 1980s and 1990s. Legislation such as the Security Service Act of 1989 and the Intelligence Services Act of 1994 placed agencies on a statutory footing, allowing officials and historians to discuss their existence more freely.
    
- **Post-Cold War Context:** The collapse of the Soviet Union and the subsequent opening of KGB archives facilitated a surge in intelligence scholarship, allowing for a clearer picture of Soviet espionage activities.
    

### **Investigating the Suspects**

Chapter 7 analyzes the potential authors of the letter, categorizing suspects into "Reds" (Bolsheviks/Communists), "Whites" (Anti-Bolsheviks), and "Blues" (British Conservatives/Intelligence).

- **The "Reds" (Bolsheviks):** Bennett concludes it is unlikely Grigori Zinoviev wrote the letter.
    
    - Soviet archives show the Bolshevik regime was genuinely confused by the letter and anxious to ratify the Anglo-Soviet trade treaty, which the letter jeopardized.
        
    - Internal Soviet rivalries, such as Stalin trying to discredit Zinoviev, are considered possible but unlikely causes for the letter's creation.
        
    - The Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) is also dismissed as a suspect, as they were under strict direction from Moscow.
        
- **The "Whites" (Anti-Bolsheviks):** The author identifies White Russian forgers as the most probable source of the document.
    
    - Following the Russian Revolution, a network of exiles produced high-quality forgeries to influence Western governments.
        
    - Vladimir Orlov, a former tsarist police officer and master forger, ran a vast network that supplied intelligence to British, German, and Polish services.
        
    - The primary suspect for the actual forgery is Ivan Pokrovsky, a former Russian naval officer based in Riga who was linked to Orlov’s network.
        
- **The "Blues" (British Interests):** While there is no evidence that the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) officially commissioned the forgery from London, elements within the British establishment likely exploited it.
    
    - British intelligence officers in Riga may have been aware of, or involved in, Pokrovsky's activities as a form of "private enterprise".
        
    - Figures such as Desmond Morton and Joseph Ball likely recognized the letter's political utility against the Labour government and facilitated its leak to the press, regardless of its authenticity.
        

### **Conclusion**

The author concludes that while no "original" letter ever existed, the document was likely a forgery created by Ivan Pokrovsky in Riga, possibly with the knowledge of local British intelligence contacts. Ultimately, the letter's authorship matters less than the willingness of British intelligence and political figures to use it as a weapon against the Labour government.
