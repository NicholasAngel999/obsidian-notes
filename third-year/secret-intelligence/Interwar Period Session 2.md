## The Ultimate Enemy: British Intelligence and Nazi Germany, 1933-1939 [conclusion]

### How did British Perception of the threat from Germany evolve between 1933-1939?

The outbreak of war in September 1939, following the German attack on Poland, offered grim proof of the validity of the original forecast set down by the DRC in 1934 - **225**

Yet in the five years after the first DRC report, that forecast had been heavily overshadowed by the subsequent evolution of an intelligence picture of Nazi Germany - **225**

The dread of war was still present in 1939, and war was still being painted in those apocalyptic hues that were a feature of interwar literature - **225**

The near and medium-term military balance was presumed to be perilous, a perception that was instrumental in convincing the cabinet to avoid the dangers of any attempt at deterrence,
above all during the Munich crisis.25 An Anglo-German confrontation was thereby postponed, yet the German armed forces of September 1938, in terms of war readiness and overall mobilised strength, were a much inferior foe compared to the military machine that performed so impressively in the campaigns of 1940. - **231**

The British effort in intelligence during the 19305 revealed a tendency to place greater faith in quantitative measures of power than in qualitative distinctions. For much of the decade German power was seen as an arithmetical sum of the number of divisions, the number of aircraft, and the number of warships she possessed, as well as the quantities coming off the production lines **238**

The most coherent expression of the British intelligence image of Nazi Germany in the phase of secrecy came with the long-overdue production of the JPC's draft strategic appreciation in October 1935. - **229**

Although the figures given out by Hitler were higher than those upon which British Intelligence had been working, no immediate shake-up in the image of German power occurred. **229**

The label honeymoon is appropriate in two senses. For one thing, as the German rearmament effort emerged from secrecy, much effort was spent on the British side in the pursuit of arms limitation agreements with the Germans as a substitute for the failure of the Geneva conference.18 With the exception of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, regarded as a model by few outside the circle of the Admiralty, these pursuits were sterile. Yet hopes persisted. Honeymoon serves also as a description of the brief relationship that grew up between the British armed forces and their German opposite numbers. No longer cloaked in secrecy, further German rearmament was ostensibly a matter of public record. **229**
