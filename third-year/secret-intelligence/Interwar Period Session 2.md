## The Ultimate Enemy: British Intelligence and Nazi Germany, 1933-1939 [conclusion]

### How did British Perception of the threat from Germany evolve between 1933-1939?

The outbreak of war in September 1939, following the German attack on Poland, offered grim proof of the validity of the original forecast set down by the DRC in 1934 - **225**

Yet in the five years after the first DRC report, that forecast had been heavily overshadowed by the subsequent evolution of an intelligence picture of Nazi Germany - **225**

The dread of war was still present in 1939, and war was still being painted in those apocalyptic hues that were a feature of interwar literature - **225**

The most coherent expression of the British intelligence image of Nazi Germany in the phase of secrecy came with the long-overdue production of the JPC's draft strategic appreciation in October 1935. - **229**

What resulted from this combination of insufficient information and substituted hypotheses was an early image of future German military might that had many optimistic features - **228**

Although the figures given out by Hitler were higher than those upon which British Intelligence had been working, no immediate shake-up in the image of German power occurred. **229**

The label honeymoon is appropriate in two senses. For one thing, as the German rearmament effort emerged from secrecy, much effort was spent on the British side in the pursuit of arms limitation agreements with the Germans as a substitute for the failure of the Geneva conference.18 With the exception of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, regarded as a model by few outside the circle of the Admiralty, these pursuits were sterile. Yet hopes persisted. Honeymoon serves also as a description of the brief relationship that grew up between the British armed forces and their German opposite numbers. No longer cloaked in secrecy, further German rearmament was ostensibly a matter of public record. **229**

The near and medium-term military balance was presumed to be perilous, a perception that was instrumental in convincing the cabinet to avoid the dangers of any attempt at deterrence, above all during the Munich crisis.25 An Anglo-German confrontation was thereby postponed, yet the German armed forces of September 1938, in terms of war readiness and overall mobilised strength, were a much inferior foe compared to the military machine that performed so impressively in the campaigns of 1940. - **231**

The British effort in intelligence during the 1930s revealed a tendency to place greater faith in quantitative measures of power than in qualitative distinctions. For much of the decade German power was seen as an arithmetical sum of the number of divisions, the number of aircraft, and the number of warships she possessed, as well as the quantities coming off the production lines **238**

Finally, the year 1939 witnessed what can only be described as a remarkable recovery of confidence and a fresh reappraisal of military facts - **240**


essentially the British started off with an optimistic view from 1933-1936 based on the under estimated military strength and assumptions of limited defensive capability. This then became a period of pessimistic blindness from 1936-1938 where worst case analysis exaggerated immediate German power and deterred intervention where we then shifted to cautious recovery of military confidence from 1938-1939. This represents the overall intelligence failure in understanding the true nature and dynamism of the nazi threat. 

#### British Perceptions

- Germany 1933-1935: small, unlikely to get too big -- "honeymoon period"
- Germany 1936-1938: Suddenly a massive threat and could jump and attack at any moment AGGHHHH. 
	- Be nice so they dont hurt us 
	- "blindness" - perceived to be stronger than they were 
- Germany 1938-1939: Finally realised that they had some weak spots and werent so strong
	- We can fight back YAYYYY





## British Intelligence and the Japanese Challenge in Asia, 1914-1941 [chapter 7 pp105-122, 125-128, 131-132]

### Between 1933 and 1941 how did the British intelligence respond to the emerging threat from Japan? 


- "The resurgence in 1933 of the Japanese threat to British interests in Asia could not have come at a worse time, for it coincided with the emergence of a revisionist and rapidly rearming Germany in Europe." - **105**

- "This period, therefore, saw a major reform and expansion of Britain's intelligence-gathering operations as the priority shifted from acquiring information on the Comintern to measuring Japan's potential for war." - **105**

- "The response of the services to the growing perception of a Japanese threat was twofold: first, they sought to improve and reform their own intelligence-gathering networks in the region, and second, they belatedly recognized the need to move towards a pooling of resources and information." - **106**

- "The structure of intelligence-gathering thus underwent major reform." - **106**

- "The Air Ministry this meant bringing a decade's prevarication to an end and finally appointing air attachés to both Peking and Tokyo." - **106**

- "Despite this unpromising environment, it was essential that the services improve their intelligence-gathering on Japan." - **106**

- "Unfortunately, the SIS proved unable to provide much useful information as its organization in Japan was still woefully inadequate." - **107**

- "Economy has to be considered, but so have the following most important points: (a) The situation in the Far East has changed completely and has left our intelligence arrangements high and dry. (b) Unless we have a good deal of Japanese wireless our intelligence will be quite inadequate, and we may find ourselves critically at fault." - **109**

- "The result of the watch was that by the beginning of 1934 the GCCS had broken the consular code and there was some progress with the IJA material." - **110**

- "Thus in April 1935 the Far Eastern Combined Bureau (FECB) at Hong Kong opened under the command of Captain John Waller, with Paymaster Commander Harry Shaw as the head of the 'Y' section." - **112**

- "In order to collate the vast amount of information that would flow from the PNIO to the C-in-C China at a time of imminent or actual hostilities, Tait recommended that a permanent Chief of Intelligence Staff (COIS) with the rank of Captain should be appointed to the China Station where he would head an onshore naval intelligence centre." - **111**

- "Tait's visit to East Asia led not only to the formation of the FECB, but also to reform of the SIS presence in the region." - **115**

- "The increasing sophistication of the intelligence structure and the expansion of the SIGINT capability meant that more information than ever before was generated about Japan's intentions and its actions in China." - **115**

- "The problem, however, was that, although these reforms improved British intelligence in the region as a whole, they largely failed to dent the wall of secrecy surrounding Japanese rearmament." - **115**

- "Thus, static ethnocentric values were being challenged, but, unfortunately, this does not seem to have affected assessments of Japan where racial views continued to hamper Britain's understanding of the Japanese military reforms and contributed in an important way to the sense of complacency that permeated Whitehall." - **120**



The British intelligence response to the emerging Japanese threat between 1933 and 1937 was characterized by **major institutional reform and expansion** , shifting priority from the Comintern to measuring Japan's war potential and leading to the formation of the **Far Eastern Combined Bureau (FECB)** to pool resources and improve signal intelligence (SIGINT). However, these efforts to improve collection, including breaking Japanese codes , were severely hampered by increased Japanese secrecy, a lack of language officers, and the persistence of complacent racial views that undermined accurate military assessments.



- British already worried about Germany so having to worry about Japan was a strategic nightmare
- They realized their old lookout spots (intelligence operations) weren't good enough, so they quickly tried to make them bigger and better, changing their focus from looking for small enemies to measuring how strong Japan was
- Created new central lookout base called *Far Eastern Combined Bureau (FECB)*
- Japan was very secretive so hard to see inside the Japanese structure to see what they were doing 
	- Also some British leaders wrongly thought Japan was slow and clumsy because they believed their own country was much better
- Britain spent a lot of time and resources to see what Japan was planning but Japan made it tough to figure out if they were actually ready for a big fight
