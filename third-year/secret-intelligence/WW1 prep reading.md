## üßê M.I.V.'s Identity and Self-Perception

The key to understanding the self-perception is the three-letter acronym **M.I.V.** and the explicitly defined phrase **"Mankinds Immortal Victory."**

- **Identity of M.I.V.:**
    
    - While the common names for the British security services are **MI5** and **MI6**, the First World War era (1914-1918) saw the creation and restructuring of numerous **Military Intelligence (MI)** sections within the War Office. There were eventually about ten "MI" sections during WWI.
        
    - Given the "MI" prefix and the context of 1918, it is highly probable that **M.I.V. was a section of Military Intelligence, where 'V' stood for the word 'Victory'** (or perhaps 'Victualling,' 'Vigilance,' or a lesser-known department, but 'Victory' aligns perfectly with the card's theme).
        
    - The use of **M.I.V.** rather than the more famous MI5 (which was known as MO5(g) and then MI5 from 1916) or MI6 suggests that this card was produced either by **another, distinct MI section** or by MI5/MI6 under a **temporary, thematic internal title** celebrating their contribution to the war effort.
        
- **Self-Perception Reflected in the Text:**
    
    - **Essential to Victory:** The deliberate choice to use the acronym **M.I.V.** _and_ then spell out **"Mankinds Immortal Victory"** indicates that the organisation saw itself as **instrumental** to achieving the eventual Allied victory. The two phrases are presented as being inextricably linked.
        
    - **Moral and Global Stake:** By calling it **"Mankind's Immortal Victory,"** the organisation elevated its mission beyond mere national defense to a global, moral struggle. This suggests a self-perception of being a **noble defender of civilisation** against an existential threat.
        
    - **Confidence and Optimism:** The year 1918 was the final, brutal year of the war. Sending such a bold New Year's greeting expresses a **strong sense of confidence** in the coming triumph, implying they believed their intelligence work had secured the foundation for success. The card is a statement of **optimism** and **conviction** in their role.
        

In essence, the image portrays the organisation's view of itself as a **vital, self-assured, and morally crucial player** whose dedicated work was directly contributing to a decisive and universally significant victory.
