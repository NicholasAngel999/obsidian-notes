## üßê M.I.V.'s Identity and Self-Perception

The key to understanding the self-perception is the three-letter acronym **M.I.V.** and the explicitly defined phrase **"Mankinds Immortal Victory."**

- **Identity of M.I.V.:**
    
    - While the common names for the British security services are **MI5** and **MI6**, the First World War era (1914-1918) saw the creation and restructuring of numerous **Military Intelligence (MI)** sections within the War Office. There were eventually about ten "MI" sections during WWI.
        
    - Given the "MI" prefix and the context of 1918, it is highly probable that **M.I.V. was a section of Military Intelligence, where 'V' stood for the word 'Victory'** (or perhaps 'Victualling,' 'Vigilance,' or a lesser-known department, but 'Victory' aligns perfectly with the card's theme).
        
    - The use of **M.I.V.** rather than the more famous MI5 (which was known as MO5(g) and then MI5 from 1916) or MI6 suggests that this card was produced either by **another, distinct MI section** or by MI5/MI6 under a **temporary, thematic internal title** celebrating their contribution to the war effort.
        
- **Self-Perception Reflected in the Text:**
    
    - **Essential to Victory:** The deliberate choice to use the acronym **M.I.V.** _and_ then spell out **"Mankinds Immortal Victory"** indicates that the organisation saw itself as **instrumental** to achieving the eventual Allied victory. The two phrases are presented as being inextricably linked.
        
    - **Moral and Global Stake:** By calling it **"Mankind's Immortal Victory,"** the organisation elevated its mission beyond mere national defense to a global, moral struggle. This suggests a self-perception of being a **noble defender of civilisation** against an existential threat.
        
    - **Confidence and Optimism:** The year 1918 was the final, brutal year of the war. Sending such a bold New Year's greeting expresses a **strong sense of confidence** in the coming triumph, implying they believed their intelligence work had secured the foundation for success. The card is a statement of **optimism** and **conviction** in their role.
        

In essence, the image portrays the organisation's view of itself as a **vital, self-assured, and morally crucial player** whose dedicated work was directly contributing to a decisive and universally significant victory.

## Thomas Boghardt  Spies of the Kaiser: German Covert  Operations in Great Britain during the  First World War Era

### What was the reality of German  espionage against Britain during the  First World War?

## The Reality of German Espionage

The reality of German covert operations, according to Boghardt, was one of **limited scope, poor quality, and minimal effectiveness**, particularly after the war began.

- **Pre-War Ineffectiveness (1909‚Äì1914):**
    
    - German Naval Intelligence (N) maintained only a **small, amateurish network** in Britain before 1914. Agents were primarily recruited for their ability to conduct reconnaissance during wartime, but they were poorly trained and largely unsuccessful at obtaining high-value military intelligence.
        
    - The **fear** of German espionage, fueled by sensationalist novels (like William Le Queux‚Äôs _Spies of the Kaiser_) and press hysteria, was **far more dangerous to Britain** than the spies themselves, as this fear led to the creation and expansion of MI5 (then the Home Section of the Secret Service Bureau).
        
- **The Crippling Blow (1914):**
    
    - At the outbreak of war, MI5 was able to use the newly passed Defence of the Realm Act to execute **pre-emptive arrests** of the entire known German spy network. Boghardt highlights that this mass round-up virtually **annihilated** Germany's established intelligence structure in Britain overnight.
        
- **Wartime Failure (1914‚Äì1918):**
    
    - Despite numerous attempts to re-establish a network, the German efforts were **consistently thwarted**. Many of the 120+ agents sent were immediately compromised, often due to poor tradecraft, interception of communications, and the vigilance of British counter-espionage.
        
    - The few notable agents, such as Carl Hans Lody, were quickly caught and executed, serving primarily as figures for **British propaganda** rather than sources of valuable intelligence for Germany.
        
    - By the war's end, Boghardt concludes there is **no convincing evidence** that German agents operating in Britain sent back any truly significant, war-altering intelligence.
        
- **Limited Success in Covert Action:**
    
    - The German secret service did attempt **covert actions**, including sabotage and, chillingly, a biological warfare campaign using **anthrax** against Allied livestock and feed in the United States.
        
    - However, sabotage operations within **Great Britain** were largely unsuccessful and did not seriously impact the British war effort.
        

In essence, Boghardt's research reveals that the true story of German espionage in WWI is not a thrilling narrative of super-spies, but a more mundane tale of a **poorly executed operation** that was effectively neutralized by a newly formed British counter-intelligence service almost before the war even began.


# book quotes

Germany was struggling to find plans to get around Britain's absolutely superior naval forces

Since the Agadir crisis in 1911, Berlin anticipated British hostility in any future major European conflict.1 This scenario proved correct, however the Admiralstab developed its operations planning solely on the assumption of an all-out surface battle between the German and British navies during the first weeks of hostilities.


The Imperial Navy entered the war in expectation of a major clash with its British counterpart. German naval intelligence acted accordingly, and ‚ÄòN‚Äôs first naval agent in Britain after the outbreak of war, Naval Lieutenant Carl Hans Lody, was instructed to report on British losses in such a battle. When this battle failed to materialize, the Admiralstab was compelled to revise its operations planning.


For example, the ‚Äòcigar order‚Äô of naval agent Willem Johannes Roos to his spymaster Hilmar Dierks in Holland ‚Äì ‚ÄòWire lowest rate 10,000 Sumatra ss 2,000 Sumatra A.K. 22,000 mixture C.I.F. Edinburgh‚Äô ‚Äì was deciphered as: ‚Äòten battleships and two old cruisers were in or about to leave Edinburgh and there were 22,000 troops.‚Äô9 Naval agent Adolf Weiszflog‚Äôs ‚Äòorder‚Äô to ‚ÄòShip immediately 160 boxes 100 ‚Äì 2 tins 80 boxes 100 ‚Äì 4 tins smoked herrings guaranteed good quality‚Äô in reality indicated the presence of sixteen large battleships and eight older destroyers in Edinburgh.10

## Nicholas Hiley  ‚ÄòDecoding German Spies:  British Spy Fiction 1908-18‚Äô  Intelligence & National  Security, 5 (1990), 55-79

### During the era of the First World War,  how did the British imagine the espionage threat?
---
**Pervasive "Secret Army"**The threat was conceived not as small teams of professional intelligence officers, but as a vast, organized, and ubiquitous **"secret army"** of 5,000 to 10,000 agents. This network was thought to be composed of German immigrants, seemingly respectable waiters, barbers, clerks, or naturalized citizens, who were secretly military officers awaiting orders.**Logistical Preparation for Invasion**Espionage was seen as an intrinsic prelude to a German **invasion** (a myth particularly popularized by William Le Queux's _Spies of the Kaiser_). The spies' primary task was not merely gathering information, but performing **preparatory work**. This included secretly mapping naval defenses, signaling targets, building secret wireless stations, and establishing hidden arms or fuel dumps, all to be activated on "The Day" of the German landing.**Domestic Treachery**The public imagined the threat as an **internal cancer**. Since the spies looked and acted like ordinary people, the resulting panic targeted all German immigrants and naturalized citizens, equating German nationality with automatic treachery and creating massive public distrust and xenophobia.**A National Humiliation**Spy fiction often presented the success of German espionage as a **moral indictment** of the British establishment‚Äîa sign of government complacency, official bureaucratic incompetence, and the ordinary citizen‚Äôs lack of vigilance. This framed spy-hunting as a vital patriotic duty for every civilian.
