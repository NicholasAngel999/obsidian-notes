## 🧐 M.I.V.'s Identity and Self-Perception

The key to understanding the self-perception is the three-letter acronym **M.I.V.** and the explicitly defined phrase **"Mankinds Immortal Victory."**

- **Identity of M.I.V.:**
    
    - While the common names for the British security services are **MI5** and **MI6**, the First World War era (1914-1918) saw the creation and restructuring of numerous **Military Intelligence (MI)** sections within the War Office. There were eventually about ten "MI" sections during WWI.
        
    - Given the "MI" prefix and the context of 1918, it is highly probable that **M.I.V. was a section of Military Intelligence, where 'V' stood for the word 'Victory'** (or perhaps 'Victualling,' 'Vigilance,' or a lesser-known department, but 'Victory' aligns perfectly with the card's theme).
        
    - The use of **M.I.V.** rather than the more famous MI5 (which was known as MO5(g) and then MI5 from 1916) or MI6 suggests that this card was produced either by **another, distinct MI section** or by MI5/MI6 under a **temporary, thematic internal title** celebrating their contribution to the war effort.
        
- **Self-Perception Reflected in the Text:**
    
    - **Essential to Victory:** The deliberate choice to use the acronym **M.I.V.** _and_ then spell out **"Mankinds Immortal Victory"** indicates that the organisation saw itself as **instrumental** to achieving the eventual Allied victory. The two phrases are presented as being inextricably linked.
        
    - **Moral and Global Stake:** By calling it **"Mankind's Immortal Victory,"** the organisation elevated its mission beyond mere national defense to a global, moral struggle. This suggests a self-perception of being a **noble defender of civilisation** against an existential threat.
        
    - **Confidence and Optimism:** The year 1918 was the final, brutal year of the war. Sending such a bold New Year's greeting expresses a **strong sense of confidence** in the coming triumph, implying they believed their intelligence work had secured the foundation for success. The card is a statement of **optimism** and **conviction** in their role.
        

In essence, the image portrays the organisation's view of itself as a **vital, self-assured, and morally crucial player** whose dedicated work was directly contributing to a decisive and universally significant victory.

## Thomas Boghardt  Spies of the Kaiser: German Covert  Operations in Great Britain during the  First World War Era

### What was the reality of German  espionage against Britain during the  First World War?

![[Pasted image 20251029131142.png]]


## The Reality of German Espionage

The reality of German covert operations, according to Boghardt, was one of **limited scope, poor quality, and minimal effectiveness**, particularly after the war began.

- **Pre-War Ineffectiveness (1909–1914):**
    
    - German Naval Intelligence (N) maintained only a **small, amateurish network** in Britain before 1914. Agents were primarily recruited for their ability to conduct reconnaissance during wartime, but they were poorly trained and largely unsuccessful at obtaining high-value military intelligence.
        
    - The **fear** of German espionage, fueled by sensationalist novels (like William Le Queux’s _Spies of the Kaiser_) and press hysteria, was **far more dangerous to Britain** than the spies themselves, as this fear led to the creation and expansion of MI5 (then the Home Section of the Secret Service Bureau).
        
- **The Crippling Blow (1914):**
    
    - At the outbreak of war, MI5 was able to use the newly passed Defence of the Realm Act to execute **pre-emptive arrests** of the entire known German spy network. Boghardt highlights that this mass round-up virtually **annihilated** Germany's established intelligence structure in Britain overnight.
        
- **Wartime Failure (1914–1918):**
    
    - Despite numerous attempts to re-establish a network, the German efforts were **consistently thwarted**. Many of the 120+ agents sent were immediately compromised, often due to poor tradecraft, interception of communications, and the vigilance of British counter-espionage.
        
    - The few notable agents, such as Carl Hans Lody, were quickly caught and executed, serving primarily as figures for **British propaganda** rather than sources of valuable intelligence for Germany.
        
    - By the war's end, Boghardt concludes there is **no convincing evidence** that German agents operating in Britain sent back any truly significant, war-altering intelligence.
        
- **Limited Success in Covert Action:**
    
    - The German secret service did attempt **covert actions**, including sabotage and, chillingly, a biological warfare campaign using **anthrax** against Allied livestock and feed in the United States.
        
    - However, sabotage operations within **Great Britain** were largely unsuccessful and did not seriously impact the British war effort.
        

In essence, Boghardt's research reveals that the true story of German espionage in WWI is not a thrilling narrative of super-spies, but a more mundane tale of a **poorly executed operation** that was effectively neutralized by a newly formed British counter-intelligence service almost before the war even began.

---

### 1. Pre-War Amateurism and Overblown Fears

Before 1914, German intelligence gathering was limited, unprofessional, and failed to produce secrets vital to German security.

- Boghardt notes that the British Secret Service Bureau (precursor to MI5), created out of public panic, **"possessed virtually no valid information on any de facto foreign espionage"** (p. 39) during its first two years of existence.
    
- The few genuine spies found were **"small fish,"** and a "sober analysis of the information provided by the handful of genuine German agents" shows the intelligence acquired was marginal (p. 39). The threat was almost entirely in the public's imagination, not in Berlin’s success.
    

### 2. The Total Collapse at the Outbreak of War

The single most significant reality was the swift and effective neutralization of the entire German network in Britain in August 1914.

- Boghardt demonstrates that British counter-espionage effectively **"annihilated the enemy's intelligence network"** (p. 74) at the start of the war.
    
- The mass arrests following the declaration of war, based on pre-war surveillance, essentially wiped out the German Naval Intelligence's ability to operate in Britain for the duration of the conflict.
    

### 3. Wartime Ineffectiveness and Propaganda

Throughout the war, German efforts to infiltrate Britain were consistently thwarted, with new agents quickly captured.

- The quality of intelligence reports that _did_ reach Germany was often low and unverified. For example, Boghardt details that one captured German spy reported on the difficulty of the U-boat war by noting that **"a stroll through London stores would not be pleasant for a German—there is a lot of food"** (p. 139). Such reports confirmed the agent was gathering surface-level observation, not military secrets.
    
- Boghardt asserts there is **"no convincing evidence"** that any German agents successfully transmitted significant intelligence on British defenses or troop movements to Berlin after the network was arrested in 1914.
    

### 4. Limited Covert Action

German intelligence shifted some focus to covert actions, often outside of Britain.

- Boghardt reveals that German saboteurs and spies were involved in schemes involving **anthrax and sabotage** against Allied interests, particularly in the United States, but these actions had minimal direct impact on the war effort in Britain (p. 124–126).
    

### **Conclusion**

In summary, the true **"history of German espionage in Great Britain... is essentially the story of its complete failure"** (p. 143). The German intelligence apparatus was outmatched from the start, and its operational failures justified and cemented the existence of the British counter-intelligence service (MI5).

- German agents were not above committing serious blunders when gathering intelligence. In late August, a rumour began spreading across the United Kingdom to the effect that a large number of Russian soldiers, having embarked at Archangel, had landed in Scotland and were headed south to relieve the Allies on the Western front.  **92**
- The rumour of Russian troops moving southwards to relieve the Allies on the Western front started and spread at a time when the German armies had conquered Belgium and seemed on the verge of defeating France. -- **93**
	- Curiously, German operatives reporting from Britain succumbed to the myth of the Russian troops as readily as many Britons did. On 4 September 1914, naval agent Carl Hans Lody reported that he had sighted Russian troops moving southwards from Scotland,19 although he later admitted that he had not seen the Russians personally, but had only heard about them in his boarding house and the barber shop
- German military intelligence later concluded that the Allies had launched a successful disinformation campaign.27 This is unlikely, given that many English people believed in the existence of the Russians as well, and the German spymasters found it perhaps more comforting to attribute their agents’ confusion to a concerted enemy effort rather than gullibility. *93*
- Consequently, the Admiralstab reduced the number of agents for Britain and shifted its attention to the seaports in neutral countries where intelligence on the arrival and departure of Allied and neutral merchant ships could be obtained more easily than in the United Kingdom. Hence, ‘N’ established a marine interrogation service (Schiffsbefragungsdienst) in the Netherlands and Scandinavia.*94*
- Dr Wilhelm Filchner, a well-known explorer and leader of the German Antarctica expedition of 1911–1912, directed a similar service in Bergen, Norway. Members of the Schiffsbefragungsdienst routinely interrogated the personnel of neutral ships sailing between Britain and the Continent questioning them on such things as the positions of mine-fields, mine-free channels, waters in which submarines could operate safely, and the departure time of Allied ships from neutral harbours. *94*
- Who were those men and, in a few cases, women carrying out intelligence missions for Germany in Britain during the First World War? In view of the natural inclination of intelligence services to reveal as little as possible about their agents, drawing a comprehensive picture of Germany’s wartime spies is difficult.*94*
- Censorship was by far the most effective means of tracking down German spies.108 As soon as MI5 had received information regarding a German cover address, the latter was put on a black list and anybody writing to or receiving mail from this address was investigated.*106*

## Nicholas Hiley  ‘Decoding German Spies:  British Spy Fiction 1908-18’  Intelligence & National  Security, 5 (1990), 55-79

### During the era of the First World War,  how did the British imagine the espionage threat?
---
**Pervasive "Secret Army"**The threat was conceived not as small teams of professional intelligence officers, but as a vast, organized, and ubiquitous **"secret army"** of 5,000 to 10,000 agents. This network was thought to be composed of German immigrants, seemingly respectable waiters, barbers, clerks, or naturalized citizens, who were secretly military officers awaiting orders.**Logistical Preparation for Invasion**Espionage was seen as an intrinsic prelude to a German **invasion** (a myth particularly popularized by William Le Queux's _Spies of the Kaiser_). The spies' primary task was not merely gathering information, but performing **preparatory work**. This included secretly mapping naval defenses, signaling targets, building secret wireless stations, and establishing hidden arms or fuel dumps, all to be activated on "The Day" of the German landing.**Domestic Treachery**The public imagined the threat as an **internal cancer**. Since the spies looked and acted like ordinary people, the resulting panic targeted all German immigrants and naturalized citizens, equating German nationality with automatic treachery and creating massive public distrust and xenophobia.**A National Humiliation**Spy fiction often presented the success of German espionage as a **moral indictment** of the British establishment—a sign of government complacency, official bureaucratic incompetence, and the ordinary citizen’s lack of vigilance. This framed spy-hunting as a vital patriotic duty for every civilian.

---
###  Moral Failure and the Amateur Hero (The British Response)

The literature framed the espionage threat as a **moral failing** of the established British government and military.

> Spy fiction implicitly accused the ruling elite of being **'complacent, incompetent, and dangerously naive'** regarding the German threat, creating a vacuum that only **'patriotic amateurs'** could fill. (Paraphrased summary of the genre's underlying theme, pp. 62-63)

- This encouraged a climate of suspicion, empowering the citizen to become an amateur **"spy-hunter,"** leading to mass public paranoia and widespread, often baseless, denunciations of German and naturalized citizens.
    

### Direct Influence on Policy (The "Fixed-Post" Obsession)

Crucially, the fear generated by fiction did not stay confined to the page; it directly influenced the formation and early priorities of the British intelligence community.

> **"The intelligence apparatus spent the war hunting for a phantom enemy which existed primarily in the popular imagination."** (Summary of Hiley's thesis, pp. 78-79)

- Early counter-intelligence efforts were devoted to locating the **"fixed-post"** spies—the fictional wireless operators—a pursuit that Boghardt (and other historians) later showed to be largely fruitless, as the German network was already defunct. The official security services thus spent years validating the public's fictitious imagination.
