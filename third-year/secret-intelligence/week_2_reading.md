Christopher Baxter and Keith Jeffery 'Intelligence and 'Official History''

# Since 1945 how was the treatment of intelligence matters evolved in government sponsored histories??

First, there is the commissioning and writing of ‘Official Histories’; and, second, the release of documents. One rationale for the UK government’s Official History programme is ‘to provide authoritative histories in their own right; [and] a reliable secondary source for historians until all the records are available in Th e National Archives’.3 We are not, however, going to discuss in any detail the release of intelligence records – which gained significant momentum after the Waldegrave Initiative on Open Government of 1993 – or the general writing of Official Histories – about which there is a slim literature – but, rather, the place of intelligence-related matters in the genre.


- post world war 2 secrecy continued to treat intelligence as too secret and sensitive to acknowledge publicly. 

- Official works of history of the war make veiled references to intelligence work such as decoding and espionage but refused to make explicit discussion of MI5 MI6 or GCHQ showing the **culture of secrecy** in Britain during the cold war era. 

“Before the 1970s, in the British History of the Second World War series, intelligence matters were generally either passed over in silence or falsified.”
(p. 289)

“Access to intelligence records was tightly controlled, and even official historians were often unaware of the full scope of intelligence activity.”
(p. 290)

“Official histories of this period presented operations as if they had been conducted without foreknowledge derived from signals intelligence.”
(p. 291)

In the immediate post-war decades, official histories largely ignored or concealed intelligence, maintaining secrecy around codebreaking and espionage work.


“It was not until the 1970s that the first tentative acknowledgements of the role of intelligence began to appear in government-sponsored histories.”
(p. 293)

“The revelation of ULTRA and the release of Bletchley Park material fundamentally changed the context in which official historians could write.”
(p. 294)

The 1970s marked a turning point — with public revelations about Bletchley Park and Ultra — prompting official historians to incorporate intelligence more openly.


“Since the 1990s, official historians have been able to draw on previously closed sources, allowing for a more balanced and authoritative treatment of intelligence.”
(p. 297)

After the 1993 Open Government reforms, official history writing entered a more transparent era, with greater archival access and fewer taboos around intelligence.


“Recent official histories, such as those of the Security Service and Secret Intelligence Service, demonstrate that intelligence is now regarded as a legitimate and integral part of state history.”
(p. 299)

“The evolution from suppression to inclusion reflects a broader cultural shift towards acknowledging intelligence as central to government policy and national security.”
(p. 301)

Today, intelligence is openly integrated within official histories — a major shift from its near-invisibility in early post-war narratives.


Between 1940s - 60s silence of intelligence systems omitted for secrecy during a cold war culture Britain and US 
1970s - First start to acknowledge Bletchley park and ULTRA officially in history
1990s - Greater access to intelligence histories, a less concerned world at the end of the cold war - **Waldergrave Initiative**
2000s - Intelligence fully incorporated in official government histories. 


One of the pleasures (and they are few enough) of reading the military series
volumes is exploring the text, in order to spot instances where the true intelligence story has been glossed over or, you might say, has been historically
enciphered. - *plays into the 40/60s*


## interesting part 
Andrew can justifiably assert that ‘no other of the world’s leading intelligence agencies has given similar access to a historian appointed from outside’.
However, there is a question mark over what exactly Andrew was able to see,
as he, himself, admitted that he had ‘been given virtually [emphasis added]
unrestricted access to the Service’s twentieth-century files as well as to the more
limited number of twenty-first century records I have asked to see’.45 On the
other hand, Jeffery was ‘absolutely confident’ that he had ‘utterly unrestricted
access to the [SIS] archives over its first forty years’.46 Th e simple answer, with
regard to why Andrew had ‘virtually unrestricted access’ and Jeffery had ‘utterly
unrestricted access’, is to do with the passage of time. Th e fact that Jeffery’s
history was ending in 1949 made disclosure much easier than would otherwise
have been the case. Andrew, on the other hand, in taking his volume up to 2009,
would have undoubtedly confronted current and still operationally sensitive
issues that could not be revealed or, for that matter, even permit access to relevant records.
In addition to documentary records, Christopher Andrew also gathered
information from serving and retired members of the Security Service.47 For
obvious reasons, Jeffery was less fortunate in this respect, though the help of
a number of retired members of the SIS who had died prior to publication is
acknowledged in his volume.48 For Jeffery, conversations with former intelligence practitioners valuably provided some human colour to supplement the
dry documentary record and illuminated the corporate ‘memory’ and esprit de
corps of the organisation.

This illustrates the most recent stage of the evolution of how the UK handles intelligence in its official histories - a stage marked by controlled transparency and professional collaboration 

In its earlier context intelligence histories were bound by strict secrecy laws and invisible to historians. 

By the later the govt. had become willing to commission and authorise full scale intelligence histories 

This section exemplifies how, since 1945, official histories have moved from silence about intelligence to state-sanctioned disclosure.
However, as Andrew’s “virtually unrestricted” phrasing shows, even today official openness is negotiated, not absolute — shaped by what the government deems safe to reveal.

Foreward to Keith Jeffery, MI6 - The History of the Secret Intelligence Service, 1909-1949 (2010)

- Foreword written by the Chief of the SIS
- Published 2010
- Piece of work detailing the first 40 year history of the SIS using permitted, inside knowledge


What does this foreword tell you about the motives of SIS in permitting publication?
- To increase public understanding of the SIS by detailing its first 40 years, without damaging national security
- To celebrate the SIS's transformation from a "small, Europe-focused organisation" and to celebrate the 'hard-working, dedicated ... courageous' members of the organisation of which they are proud

Does the security restriction automatically undermine its claim to be a 'rigorous history'?
- Acknowledges the difficulties: "Throughout, we have been at pains to provide the necessary openness to enable the author to tell our history definitively"
- Jeffery, however, is given unrestricted access and allowed to make is own, independent judgements

Define rigorous history?
I would argue Jeffery's work absolutely rigorous in that it is required to be extremely thorough and careful, due to the highly sensitive nature of the content and the constrictions on what information can and cannot be made public - it is rigorous out of necessity. 
However, 'rigorous history' would be characterised by being able to be critiqued and put under academic scrutiny, and this is immediately made near-impossible as the sources and research made available to Jeffery are not made available to his fellow researchers. Thus as historians were are required to take his perspective at face value, which is an issue when we know that it is essentially a propaganda piece celebrating the Secret Intelligence Service.

Secret State Reading:
Gerald Hughes, Philip Murphy & Philip Davies,
‘The British Secret Intelligence Service, 1909-1949’,
Intelligence & National Security, 26 (2011), 701-
729.
How does Hughes place Jeffery’s history
within the wider context of intelligence
history, and what is his assessment of the
book?
    • Keith Jeffery reminds us that the SIS is ‘the oldest continuously surviving intelligence-gathering organisation in the world.’
        ◦ Hughes then frames this in context by mentioning the SIS’ culture of secrecy, and how at one point it was treated as a matter of policy.
        ◦ The experiences in the First World War reinforced the ‘veneration of secrecy
    • Quotes Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain (1924): It is of the essence of a Secret Service that it must be secret, and if you once begin disclosure it is perfectly obvious to me . . . that there is no longer any Secret Service and that you must do without it.’ 
        ◦ His successors would later reinforce this point by saying essentially that only in Britain that the Foreign Intelligence Service, charged by the foreign secretary, officially doesn’t exist
    • This attitude, to an extent, has been relaxed as the SIS now has an official history.
    • Hughes explores the idea that the British government is one of the most secretive in the world, he quotes a Venetian trader from the 17th century. ‘‘There is no government on earth which divulges its affairs less than England, or is more punctually informed of the affairs of others.’
    • Mentions the Official Secrets Act of 1911. Another piece of law that forced the SIS to complete and utter secrecy to the point of denying it’s existence
    • Quotes Max Weber, a critic of Governmental Secrecy, ‘The concept of the ‘‘ofﬁcial secret’’ is the speciﬁc invention of bureaucracy, and nothing is so fanatically defended by the bureaucracy as this attitude, which cannot really be justiﬁed beyond these speciﬁcally qualiﬁed areas.’ TLDR Governmental Secrecy is an invention of Bureaucrats, defended by Bureaucrats and makes sense only to Bureaucrats.
    • The official secrets act and this culture of secrecy regarding the SIS meant that any critique or enquiry into their activities was near enough impossible, eliminating public debate on the topic pp. 703
        ◦ The ability to site national security as a means of shutting down debate was no longer an option for policymakers as time went along
    • Historians have often combated the government in matters of secrecy in the interest of archival release and most likely study
    • Jeffery himself concedes that while ‘Openness is an admirable ideal. . . it will always be constrained by such factors as tradition, practicality, disposition, sincerity, raison d’état, carelessness and even incompetence’. 24 Against this, and betraying many of the suspicions beloved of the historian, Angus Mitchell observes that for the authors of the recent histories of MI525 and MI6 there is an ‘unstated assumption that secrecy is a good thing’. Pp. 705
    • Jeffrey comments that he has found no evidence that the SIS has neither casually nor maliciously carried out the destruction of classified documents to cover up embarrassing facts surrounding the SIS. He also mentions other scholarly critiques of such practices such as the Stasi
    • ‘In allowing ‘Jeffery to disclose information in the History hitherto kept secret’ SIS was ‘careful neither to compromise national security, nor undermine the Government’s policy of neither conﬁrming nor denying matters of intelligence interest (NCND).’34 Yet, despite the intimacy between SIS and its author, the word ‘ofﬁcial’ does not formally appear anywhere near Keith Jeffery’s book’ pp. 707
    • The idea of a official history was discussed by Jeffrey Gray in 2003
        ◦ ‘‘To its critics [ofﬁcial history] should be viewed with suspicion because it bears state sanction in an age where ‘‘ofﬁcial’’ versions and explanations of events are frequently synonymous with ‘‘cover up’’, where not indeed with ofﬁcial lying.’ Pp. 707
    • In 2004, Richard Aldrich noted that British governments had the ability to hide secrets post 1945, by publishing their own packaged versions of past events in the Secret Service in order to maintain secrecy of larger events they either wanted to remain unexplored or unknown
    • ‘While there will always be some dissent towards any ofﬁcial historian, Jeffery was a suitably eminent and respected professional academic to be official (we could use the word ‘nominated’) historian of MI6.43 And his book will, undoubtedly, be to the liking of the vast majority of his fellow professionals’ pp. 709
    • Foreign Secretary William Hague spoke on the book
        ◦ This history of our Secret Intelligence Service provides a unique insight into an organisation of great national and international importance. It sets out in compelling detail how SIS developed over 40 years from modest beginnings to be a world-leading intelligence service. The debt of gratitude we owe to our intelligence and security services is hard to overstate. Without their unstinting efforts, the defence of this country, its values and way of life would have been imperilled many times. Pp. 710
    • How will Jeffery’s book affect popular mythology surrounding SIS?
        ◦ Quoting Herbert Butterfield, ‘‘The raconteur knows too well that, if he investigates the truth of the matter, he is only too likely to lose his good story.’’
    • As the intelligence writer Nigel West observes, ‘It is one of the paradoxes of the British intelligence tradition that whereas there is a convention, and now a criminal statute, to prevent intelligence ofﬁcers from making unauthorised disclosures, more have done so in this country than anywhere else in the world.’54 Such has been the level of scrutiny directed towards SIS – and British intelligence generally –that there has already been any number of ‘scoops’ in works that never enjoyed Jeffery’s archival access
    • To answer the question: Hughes places his work as one of the first significant pieces of Intelligence historiography that allowed secrets and a general timeline of events to be disclosed without affecting state security and secrets.
What does Murphy praise in Jeffery’s
history and what does he criticise?
    • ‘Jeffery has no time for this charge, and refutes it on a number of grounds. First, he suggests, MI6 deserves credit for nurturing the growth of Bletchley and for protecting the security of its product. Secondly, Jeffery argues that the ‘sheer institutional survival’ (p.748) of MI6 over the ﬁrst 40 years of its existence is a mark of its success, and that it would be ‘naive’ to attribute that survival purely to the Service’s sovereignty over Bletchley.’
    • As such he is keen to highlight the significance of human intelligence MI6 gathered and its role in the ‘Double Cross’ of information
    • Despite Jeffery’s claim that it was ‘an unparalleled treat to be let loose in the [MI6] archive’ (p.x), it almost goes without saying that this was a thankless task.
    • The enforced cut-off point of 1949 always seemed excessively restrictive, as well as somewhat self-defeating in terms of presenting SIS as a competent and professional organization.
        ◦ Effectivley, fails to mention the restrictiveness of these archives
    • For the immediate post-war period, Jeffery’s greatest ‘scoop’ is the evidence he produces of MI6 sabotage operations against ships taking Jewish refugees from Italian ports to Palestine. Yet an account of this affair, based on published sources, featured in Stephen Dorril’s history of MI6 – which appeared a decade ago, you can say that means no new interesting information has arisen
    • The obvious criticism to be made of Jeffery would be that he tells us in great detail a story we already know. Indeed, it might be suggested that, as an institutional study, his ofﬁcial history lacks the clarity of analysis offered by Davies,precisely because of its accumulation of detail from the archives.
    • Murphy does praise the skill of which he’s gathered into the book, and that there is plenty of interest in there
    • Jeffery’s account of the immediate post-war period also contains a mass of interesting information. There are, for example, an intriguing discussions of the ﬁnancial outlay required to buy the silence of wartime agents, of the recruitment of former Nazi intelligence ofﬁcers and of the implications for MI6 of its absorption of the Special Operations Executive 
Which aspects of Jeffery’s history does
Davies highlight and why?
    • ‘Jeffery’s ofﬁcial history has been awaited with considerable curiosity and anticipation since it was ﬁrst announced, not least because of the reportedly somewhat ramshackle and fragmentary quality of SIS’s own archives.’
    • ‘Coupled with that agency’s determination to preserve the conﬁdentiality of its sources, the opportunities available to Jeffery as ofﬁcial historian often seemed to the outside observer to be more than offset by the limitations and challenges’
    • ‘The discussion of events presaging SIS’s establishment, as half of the 1909 Secret Service Bureau (SSB), is somewhat cursory compared with other aspects of the narrative, but Jeffery avoids falling prey to the rather condescending conventional wisdom that has prevailed in historical quarters.’
    • ‘As Jeffery works through the war, the early anti-Soviet efforts at home and abroad during the inter-war years, the Second World War and the changing of gears for a rematch against Soviets in the Cold War, he provides much new information about SIS’s development and activities’
    • It is particularly satisfying to ﬁnd a detailed survey of SIS penetration of Hitler’s Germany during the Second World War that challenges another conventional wisdom,that the agency was blind and unproductive against Germany after the fall of Europe.
    • Davies essentially highlights agency activity during the second world war in response to German and Soviet intelligence activities, in the case of Germany it is highlighted to challenge the conventional wisdom that the agency was blind and unproductive against Germany after Europe fell
