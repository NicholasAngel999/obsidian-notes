gets recruited after network goes kaput

can you give me a run down of browser like helium, zen, floorp and other browsers that are less known but could fit my use case, ive told you want i want from a browser in the past so use that information to help you decide
 im using brave and its ad blocker is good but ive seen some issues concerning privacy on brave. vivaldi seems cool but also a lot and probably high resource usage. i have helium installed and i do love its UI but the only drawback right now is widevine in my eyes. what other unconventional browsers can you suggest
