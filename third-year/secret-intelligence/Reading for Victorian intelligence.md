## 🧭 **Answer: The Motives Behind Establishing the Secret Service Bureau (SSB) in 1909**

The 1909 CID sub-committee paper reveals that the **motives of the British government departments** (the War Office, Admiralty, and Home Office) were driven by a blend of **security concerns, administrative efficiency, and political discretion.**

---

### **1. Fear of Foreign Espionage — Especially German**

The document repeatedly highlights concern about **“foreign agents”** and the difficulty of getting **accurate information about Germany’s naval preparations**.

- Paragraph 5 notes Britain’s intelligence on _foreign ports and dockyards_—particularly in Germany—was “defective.”
    
- This anxiety reflected the **pre-First World War naval arms race** with Germany.  
    Thus, a major motive was **national defence and the protection of naval and military secrets**.
    

> → The SSB was created primarily to **counter German espionage and improve intelligence gathering abroad**.

---

### **2. Desire for Coordination and Continuity**

The report criticizes the existing situation in which secret service duties were **split between departments** with “constant changes in the officers who deal with secret service.”  
This lack of continuity meant there was **no consistent system** or institutional memory.

> → The motive here was **administrative efficiency**: to create a _permanent, central body_ linking the War Office, Admiralty, and police.

---

### **3. Need for Secrecy and Plausible Deniability**

Paragraph 4 states foreign governments used secret bureaux so that **officials would not be directly linked with spies**, ensuring “no direct evidence can be obtained that the country is having dealings with them.”  
The British departments wanted the same protection.

> → Another motive was **political and moral insulation** — to protect the government and military from public scandal or diplomatic embarrassment arising from direct contact with spies.

---

### **4. Use of Civilian and Police Expertise**

The recommendation to use **private detectives and police officers** (paras. 9–10, 13e) shows that the departments recognised the need for **professional investigative skills** beyond military circles.  
They wanted to **blend military, naval, and civilian expertise** to handle espionage effectively.

> → This shows a motive of **practical capability-building**: creating an intelligence service with broader reach and operational discretion.

---

### **5. Cost-Conscious Pragmatism**

Paragraph 14 provides a detailed budget and even suggests savings by avoiding the cost of an extra General Staff officer.  
This indicates that while the departments saw espionage as vital, they also sought a **low-cost, bureaucratically efficient solution**.

> → The SSB was conceived as a **small, economical experiment**, not a vast new bureaucracy.
