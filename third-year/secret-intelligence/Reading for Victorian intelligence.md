# What does this document tell us about the motives of British government departments when establishing the SSB in 1909?

## üß≠ **Answer: The Motives Behind Establishing the Secret Service Bureau (SSB) in 1909**

The 1909 CID sub-committee paper reveals that the **motives of the British government departments** (the War Office, Admiralty, and Home Office) were driven by a blend of **security concerns, administrative efficiency, and political discretion.**

---

### **1. Fear of Foreign Espionage ‚Äî Especially German**

The document repeatedly highlights concern about **‚Äúforeign agents‚Äù** and the difficulty of getting **accurate information about Germany‚Äôs naval preparations**.

- Paragraph 5 notes Britain‚Äôs intelligence on _foreign ports and dockyards_‚Äîparticularly in Germany‚Äîwas ‚Äúdefective.‚Äù
    
- This anxiety reflected the **pre-First World War naval arms race** with Germany.  
    Thus, a major motive was **national defence and the protection of naval and military secrets**.
    

> ‚Üí The SSB was created primarily to **counter German espionage and improve intelligence gathering abroad**.

---

### **2. Desire for Coordination and Continuity**

The report criticizes the existing situation in which secret service duties were **split between departments** with ‚Äúconstant changes in the officers who deal with secret service.‚Äù  
This lack of continuity meant there was **no consistent system** or institutional memory.

> ‚Üí The motive here was **administrative efficiency**: to create a _permanent, central body_ linking the War Office, Admiralty, and police.

---

### **3. Need for Secrecy and Plausible Deniability**

Paragraph 4 states foreign governments used secret bureaux so that **officials would not be directly linked with spies**, ensuring ‚Äúno direct evidence can be obtained that the country is having dealings with them.‚Äù  
The British departments wanted the same protection.

> ‚Üí Another motive was **political and moral insulation** ‚Äî to protect the government and military from public scandal or diplomatic embarrassment arising from direct contact with spies.

---

### **4. Use of Civilian and Police Expertise**

The recommendation to use **private detectives and police officers** (paras. 9‚Äì10, 13e) shows that the departments recognised the need for **professional investigative skills** beyond military circles.  
They wanted to **blend military, naval, and civilian expertise** to handle espionage effectively.

> ‚Üí This shows a motive of **practical capability-building**: creating an intelligence service with broader reach and operational discretion.

---

### **5. Cost-Conscious Pragmatism**

Paragraph 14 provides a detailed budget and even suggests savings by avoiding the cost of an extra General Staff officer.  
This indicates that while the departments saw espionage as vital, they also sought a **low-cost, bureaucratically efficient solution**.

> ‚Üí The SSB was conceived as a **small, economical experiment**, not a vast new bureaucracy.

## **üéØ Summary**

The document shows that the **British government‚Äôs motives** in 1909 were:

|Motive|Evidence from Document|Explanation|
|---|---|---|
|**National security**|Concern about German espionage (paras 5‚Äì6)|Protect Britain from foreign spies and improve overseas intelligence.|
|**Administrative coordination**|Complaints about lack of continuity (para 4)|Create a central, permanent bureau to unify War Office and Admiralty efforts.|
|**Secrecy / plausible deniability**|‚ÄúTo serve as a screen‚Ä¶ so no direct evidence‚Äù (para 3‚Äì4)|Shield officials from direct contact with spies.|
|**Operational expertise**|Use of detectives and retired officers (paras 8‚Äì10)|Combine police and military skill sets.|
|**Economy**|Budgeting and cost-saving (para 14‚Äì15)|Keep the new service small and efficient.|

### **In short:**

This 1909 document reveals that the British departments established the SSB not just to fight spies, but to **create a discreet, coordinated, and economical intelligence system** that could **protect Britain‚Äôs security while protecting officials from exposure.**




### **Summary:**

**Stephen Harris, _British Military Intelligence in the Crimean War_ (1999), Chapter 4: How Did the British Army Collect Intelligence in the Crimea?**

1. **British Intelligence Deficiencies (October 1853):**
    
    - The British Army lacked a permanent intelligence system. It struggled with gathering, processing, and disseminating information and lacked specialists familiar with the geography of the region.
        
    - Several foreign diplomats offered their services, but Lord Raglan, British commander, rejected their help.
        
2. **Charles Cattely‚Äôs Role:**
    
    - Cattely, a civilian with deep knowledge of Southern Russia, was recruited by the British Army despite not being a military officer. He had extensive experience in Crimea, speaking multiple languages and having valuable knowledge of the local geography and economy.
        
    - After being forced to leave Russia due to declining relations, he came to Britain and offered his services, becoming a key figure in British intelligence in Crimea. His role was ambiguous, initially unofficial but evolving into more significant intelligence duties.
        
3. **Cattely‚Äôs Influence on Intelligence:**
    
    - Cattely used his personal connections and knowledge of the region to collect and interpret intelligence, particularly about Russian capabilities and strategic positions.
        
    - He set up a rudimentary intelligence structure in October 1854 and began interrogating prisoners and providing strategic advice directly to Lord Raglan.
        
    - Despite his civilian status, Cattely quickly became integral to the British intelligence operations, running the Secret Intelligence Department (SID) and playing a strategic advisory role.
        
4. **Intelligence Sources and Challenges:**
    
    - Cattely‚Äôs primary sources of intelligence were spies, local Tartars, and deserters. His background in commerce and knowledge of the region made him a valuable asset despite being a civilian.
        
    - The limitations of the Allied siege of Sevastopol impeded reconnaissance efforts, and cavalry were stretched thin due to defensive duties. Cattely used a mix of traditional spies and agents to gather information on Russian forces.
        
    - Prisoners and deserters played a crucial role, particularly after 1855 when larger numbers, including Polish deserters, began to defect.
        
5. **SID's Organization and Evolution:**
    
    - The SID, under Cattely, was set up under crude conditions but grew into a more structured intelligence operation. Cattely was granted significant autonomy and resources, allowing him to run operations largely independently.
        
    - The establishment of the SID helped address the British army‚Äôs severe intelligence shortcomings during the Crimean War.

**Bernard Porter, _Plots and Paranoia: A History of Political Espionage in Britain, 1790-1988_ (1989), Chapter 6: Why Was the Metropolitan Police Irish Branch Established and How/Why Did Its Remit Evolve?**

1. **Irish Espionage and Political Crisis (1880s):**
    
    - In the 1880s, Britain faced a growing threat of espionage, particularly linked to Irish nationalist movements. The Fenian bombing campaigns in 1881 and 1883, alongside political violence related to Irish refugees, prompted the British government to establish a more organized response.
        
2. **Creation of the Special Branch:**
    
    - The Special Branch was created in response to the Fenian threat, initially set up within the Metropolitan Police in 1883 or 1887, depending on the timeline. Its primary aim was to monitor Irish political activities and track espionage.
        
    - The immediate catalyst for the Special Branch‚Äôs creation was a bombing campaign in mainland Britain, including high-profile targets like the Tower of London and London Underground stations.
        
3. **Challenges and Tensions within the Special Branch:**
    
    - The department faced difficulties in coordinating intelligence, often plagued by infighting and lack of control over the police force‚Äôs broader operations.
        
    - After several bombings and political assassinations, including the 1881 assassination of Tsar Alexander II and the Irish Invincibles‚Äô murder of two British officials in 1882, the need for a more robust espionage apparatus became urgent.
        
4. **The Branch‚Äôs Evolution and Early Failures:**
    
    - Early operations by the Special Branch were hampered by internal struggles, but over time it evolved to address these issues. The branch eventually became more effective, especially in managing Irish and foreign political refugees deemed a threat.

1. **British Government‚Äôs Motives for Establishing a Secret Service Bureau (SSB) in 1909:**
    
    - The British government was motivated by the increasing need for organized and effective intelligence, especially in the context of rising international tensions and the growing complexity of espionage.
        
    - The establishment of the SSB was seen as essential for securing the British Empire‚Äôs interests and responding to emerging threats, particularly from foreign powers and political subversives.
        
    - The committee concluded that a more formalized and centralized intelligence structure was necessary for Britain to compete with foreign espionage networks and protect its strategic interests.
        
2. **Impact of Changing Security Needs:**
    
    - The decision to establish the SSB was driven by the recognition that espionage had become a critical aspect of national security. The Bureau was designed to formalize and streamline intelligence operations, setting the stage for the modern intelligence agencies in Britain.



# defectors 
number of deserters/defectors 
- don't get many early on
- they first suspected the cavalry weren't doing their job - they were killing them 

defector is essentially someone who deserts their own army
