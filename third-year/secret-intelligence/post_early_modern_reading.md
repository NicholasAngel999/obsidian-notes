*What does Cruso's advice tell us about military intelligence-gathering in the seventeenth Century*

**AI ANSWER**
Cruso shows that seventeenth-century military intelligence was a deliberate, practical, and high-risk art centred on human sources: cavalry reconnaissance and captured men, paid and infiltrated spies (including your own soldiers), local informants, counter-intelligence measures, and deliberate deception. It was formalized into routines and punishments, but remained dangerous, ad hoc, and heavily dependent on personal trust and discipline.

**READING**

"Every good commander must have these two grounds for his actions; 1. The knowledge of his own forces, and wants (knowing that the enemie may have notice thereof, and therefore must be always studying for remedies, if the enemie should come suddenly upon him) 2. The assurance of the condition and estate of the enemie, his commodities, and necessities, his counsels and designes: thereby begetting divers occasions, which afterward bring forth victories." - First section of "of intelligence" which kind of shows some complexities and forethought that goes into intelligence gathering. 


"an expert officer, with 20 or 25 of the best mounted, stoutest, and hardiest Harquebusiers (or mixt of Cuirassiers and Harquebusiers, according to Melzo) with two Trumpets are to be employed."  - Active recon by cavalry 

Primarily Human and local intelligence with information coming from eyes, ears, prisoners and locals. 

Cavalry was a major part of reconnaissance in the era mounted patrols performed both scouting and capture missions. 
"If they find the enemie marching, they shall follow him on either flank (as opportunitie shall direct them ) or on the rear, or meet him on the front assaying to take some that are disbanded, or some forager. In the night they must approach the enemies armie, assaying to take some Sentinell, or some disbanded souldier in some of the houses thereabout"

Secrecy and counter measures were already in place with provosts and strict camp discipline, punishments and controlled communication guarded against infiltration. 
" No stranger is to be lodged within the quarters of any officer or souldier without speciall license. To this purpose a sudden command useth to be published, for every man to repair to his tent or cabin, whereby the Provost takes such as are remaining in the streets; which are made to give account of their businesse there"

Deception was strategy - Feeding selective truths allowing rumors and staging false preperations were deliberate to mislead spies. 
“A means may be used to deceive the enemy by his own spies, giving it out that you intend one thing, and do a contrary: also by seeming no way mistrustful of the enemies drummes and trumpets (which are often sent with some pretended message, to heare and observe) and letting fall some words (which carry some probability) in their hearing, which they may take for truth.”

Jims reasons get backed up here with mention of rewards for spies and methods for turning suspects show reliance on payments persuasion and loyalties rather than intelligence agencies 
“For which purpose it behoveth him to have good spies, which must be exceeding well rewarded, that so they may be the readier to expose themselves to all dangers.”


Similar to what Jim was saying interms of clearance and knowledge - keeping agents detached and unaware of one another minimised compromise - early form of cell structure
“Of these it is good to have many, and in severall places, the one knowing nothing of the other.”

Cruso does point out intelligences serious reliability problems with sources such as boors
“There are also spies which are called double, which must be men of great fidelity… But these kind of spies cannot continue long without being discovered.”
“The boors use also to serve for spies, as well women as men… but these are not always to be trusted, neither are they so well able to judge of or to pierce into businesse, and the lesse assurance and information to be had by their relations.”

Cruso's advice shows how seventeenth century military intelligence was centered almost entirely around people and spies and captured soldiers. It was dangerous uncertain and unreliable with commanders using mounted patrols agents and strict counter espionage measures to gather and protect information.

*How was intelligence collected by the British during the Peninsular War*

"In times of war this intelligence was rarely used at the military strategic or operational level usually because the military were able to acquire their own operational and more commonly tactical intelligence to make timely and effective decisions"

"In it, General Lord Wellington, commanding the Anglo-Portuguese Army relied on intelligence from local British diplomats to develop strategic plan. The British diplomats assigned to Portugal and Spain, Charles Stuart and Henry Wellesley, established extensive civilian intelligence-gathering networks which fascinated military planning."

Diplomats acted as spymasters recruiting local informants and maintaining contact with partisans who had access to French movements
“Wellesley’s embassy in Cádiz became the nerve centre of intelligence collection, drawing reports from agents across southern Spain.”

Merchants travellers and other civilians were providing intelligence by reporting troop movements and political developments 
“Merchants and local civilians often acted as intermediaries, passing on information that would later reach Wellington’s headquarters.”

Information was collected and compiled from cavalry and patrols and the civilian intelligence coming in to make a more cohersive picture
“The flow of information from Stuart and Wellesley’s diplomatic networks gave Wellington a far clearer picture of French intentions than his cavalry patrols alone could provide.”

“Guerrilla leaders supplied much of the most accurate intelligence on French detachments, garrisons, and supply lines.”

coded letters were used 
“Reports were carried by trusted couriers and often written in cipher to protect sources from French discovery.”

British intelligence was collected through a web of informants from diplomats, merchants, guerrillas and local agents organised by Stuart and Wellesley. These diplomats acted as spymasters, coordinating civilian and military sources who reported French movements and political developments via coded correspondence and couriers. This informal, human-based system gave Wellington vital insight into enemy plans.

    1. Introduction: Continuities and Changes
Summary Timeline
Period	Development
16th c.	Walsingham’s ad-hoc spy networks
17th c.	Cipher and postal interception (Post Office)
18th c.	Family Embassy system; ambassadors as intelligence gatherers
1793	Alien Office – early domestic security service
1803	Depot of Military Knowledge – attempt at central analysis
1808–14	Peninsular War – localised intelligence networks under Wellington
1853–56	Crimean War – flexible adaptation of civilian intelligence
Late 19th–20th c.	Gradual institutionalisation of intelligence (toward modern MI5/MI6)

Historical Background
    • Origins:
        ◦ British diplomatic services have long been tied to intelligence collection.
        ◦ Before the 20th century (pre-radio era), intelligence was strategic, guiding foreign and war policy rather than battlefield tactics.
    • Use in Warfare:
        ◦ Military forces typically generated their own tactical intelligence.
        ◦ Diplomatic intelligence was often too slow for operational use.
        ◦ Example: Napoleonic Wars—most amphibious operations lacked adequate intelligence.

2. The Peninsular War (1808–1814)
    • Exception:
        ◦ Britain’s sustained engagement on the European mainland.
        ◦ Lord Wellington relied heavily on intelligence from British diplomats in Portugal and Spain (Charles Stuart, Henry Wellesley).
        ◦ They created civilian intelligence networks to aid strategic military planning.

3. Development of Intelligence Organisation
Continuities and Changes
    • The Peninsular War marks a turning point between:
        ◦ 18th-century ad-hoc intelligence methods, and
        ◦ 19th–20th century institutionalisation of intelligence services.
Key Issues before Institutionalisation
    • Problems: time delays, poor communication, unreliability.
    • Intelligence was vital but not organised systematically.

4. Early English Intelligence Structures
    • 16th century:
        ◦ Francis Walsingham (Elizabeth I’s secretary) employed agents ad hoc — regarded as the “first great spymaster.”
        ◦ Daniel Defoe later worked as a government agent.
    • Domestic vs. Foreign Intelligence:
        ◦ No early distinction between domestic (“security”) and foreign intelligence.
        ◦ Walsingham’s prosecution of Mary, Queen of Scots = early domestic security case.

5. Evolution of Domestic Intelligence
    • English Civil War:
        ◦ Clergy (e.g., John Wallis) involved in cipher breaking and code analysis.
        ◦ Led to Britain’s first “Decypherer” (William Blencowe).
    • Post Office (1657):
        ◦ Contained Secret and Private Offices for intercepting and decoding mail.
    • Alien Office (1793):
        ◦ Monitored foreign nationals; seen as origin of the Security Service (MI5).
        ◦ Conducted domestic surveillance and espionage abroad related to internal security.
    • Both organisations disbanded or restructured by the mid-19th century.

6. Development of Foreign Intelligence
    • Resident Embassies (15th century):
        ◦ Originated in Italian city-states.
        ◦ Ambassadors gathered information and negotiated alliances.
        ◦ Gradually became accepted in Northern Europe.
    • 18th century:
        ◦ Ambassadors and emissaries routinely gathered military intelligence (e.g., on French and Spanish navies).
        ◦ Consuls observed naval activity at ports.

7. The “Family Embassy” System
    • Operated as extended households run by ambassadors.
    • Embassy staff included:
        ◦ Confidential secretaries (official intelligence role).
        ◦ Servants and courtiers (informal sources of gossip/intel).
        ◦ Local merchants, bankers, court insiders—sources of economic and political intelligence.
    • Also maintained spy networks and bribed officials for information.
    • Very costly but effective for the period.

8. Institutionalisation and Centralisation
    • Foreign Office (London):
        ◦ Began centralising collection and analysis of intelligence.
        ◦ Ambassadors/residents reported enemy activities and intentions.
    • War of 1793 (Britain vs. France):
        ◦ Emphasis on agent and informant networks increased.
        ◦ Produced far more intelligence than mail interception in peacetime.

9. Intelligence in the Iberian Peninsula (1808 Onwards)
    • Diplomatic Roles Expanded:
        ◦ Diplomats instructed to form networks of agents and correspondents to collect strategic intelligence (troop strength, enemy positions).
        ◦ Information forwarded to London but often outdated due to long travel times.
    • Depot of Military Knowledge (1803):
        ◦ Established for analysis and collection of military intelligence; limited effectiveness due to lack of resources.

10. Wellington’s Use of Intelligence
    • Significance:
        ◦ Deployment of Wellington’s army to Portugal made intelligence operationally vital.
    • Network Building:
        ◦ Charles Stuart (Portugal) and Henry Wellesley (Spain) built civilian intelligence systems.
        ◦ Intelligence increasingly decentralised—managed locally for quicker use.
    • Outcome:
        ◦ Recognised need for locally controlled, institutionalised networks for efficiency.
        ◦ However, no formal system was established yet

11. Lessons and Legacy
    • Continuity: Lack of institutionalisation persisted → allowed flexibility.
    • Crimean War (1853–56):
        ◦ Lord Raglan (Wellington’s former secretary) recreated civilian intelligence networks with diplomat Charles Cattley.
        ◦ Demonstrated adaptability from Peninsular experience.
    • Transition:
        ◦ Peninsular War = early model of coordinated military–civilian intelligence.
        ◦ Set groundwork for later formal intelligence structures (19th–20th century).
2. Intelligence Organisation in the Iberian Peninsula
Background & Experience
    • Charles Stuart
        ◦ Previously ran an intelligence mission in Spain (1808–09); provided intelligence to General Sir John Moore.
        ◦ Earlier posts: Secretary of Legation (Vienna) and Embassy (St Petersburg) — gained experience with intelligence handling.
        ◦ Skilled in coordinating networks and secret correspondence.
    • Henry Wellesley
        ◦ Younger brother of Wellington and Richard Wellesley (Foreign Secretary).
        ◦ Appointment created a family network controlling policy in the Peninsula.
        ◦ Managed southern/eastern Spanish intelligence while Stuart covered the north.

Intelligence Communication Challenges
    • Information traveled slowly (couriers on horseback; up to one month).
    • Long-distance communication across Spain and Portugal caused delays and risk of interception.
    • Despite this, couriers were still faster than army divisions — intelligence was often usable.

Structure of the Intelligence Network
Types of Intelligence Gatherers
Type	Description	Reliability / Role
Correspondents / Confidential Persons	Local informants or patriotic civilians, often unpaid or paid per report. Reported local enemy activity.	Cheap but unreliable; provided “raw” data; stationary.
Agents	Paid professionals; moved between locations to collect and deliver intelligence personally.	More reliable; expected to observe enemy movements closely; maintained mini-networks of correspondents.
Spies	Operatives tasked with covert influence or espionage (e.g., stirring uprisings).	Rarely effective; limited influence.
    • Overlap of terms (“agent,” “spy,” “confidential person”)—used interchangeably in documents.
    • Correspondents → local and static
Agents → mobile and analytical

Geographic Scope & Division of Labour
    • Stuart (Lisbon): Controlled intelligence from northern Spain and French border (e.g., Bayonne, Irun).
    • Henry Wellesley (Cádiz): Controlled southern/eastern Spain (Andalusia, Seville, Cádiz).
    • Both exchanged intelligence regularly and kept each other informed.

Collaboration with Native Governments
Portugal
    • Minister for War Manuel Forjaz exchanged intelligence with Stuart and Wellington.
    • Portuguese network weak outside its own borders; main contribution = intercepted dispatches.
Spain
    • Highly developed intelligence system; similar to Britain’s.
    • Spanish Minister of War Eusebio de Bardají cooperated with Wellesley.
    • Example: Manuel Sobral, Spanish agent in Puerto de Santa María, ran a large network from Cádiz to Seville.
        ◦ Collected troop numbers, positions, and regional news.
        ◦ Wellesley considered Sobral his most valuable informant.

Organisation of British Civilian Networks
Stuart’s Network (Lisbon-based)
    • Built upon:
        1. Predecessors’ contacts (John Charles Villiers, British consuls).
        2. Spanish provincial juntas and guerrilla leaders.
        3. His own agents across Spain and France (notably Bayonne & Irun).
    • Used licensed merchant vessels (“Chass-Marees”) for coastal communication and smuggling intelligence.
    • Bayonne/Irun: strategic hubs—counted French reinforcements crossing into Spain.
        ◦ Example: León Roblado, key agent reporting troop movements until captured (1811).
    • Operated rotating system of 2–3 agents in Bayonne (1810):
        ◦ Monthly intelligence cycles; personally delivered reports to Lisbon.
        ◦ Cost ~£300/month — high but effective for short-term needs.
Wellesley’s Network (Cádiz-based)
    • Tapped into:
        ◦ Spanish intelligence (through Bardají and Sobral).
        ◦ British consuls (John Hunter, James Duff, etc.).
        ◦ Contacts from his brother Richard and the Frere brothers.
    • Provided crucial intelligence on:
        ◦ French forces in Andalusia (Marshal Soult, Marshal Victor).
        ◦ Movements near Cádiz and Seville.
    • Supplied both military and political intelligence (e.g., morale and factionalism in Joseph Bonaparte’s court).

Quality & Use of Intelligence
    • Intelligence from Bayonne was vital:
        ◦ Showed reinforcements entering Spain before the 1810 French invasion of Portugal.
        ◦ Allowed Wellington to anticipate Masséna’s moves.
    • Civilian intelligence became increasingly systematic but remained ad-hoc due to limited funding and technology.
    • By 1812–13:
        ◦ Stuart’s and Wellesley’s correspondents provided political, military, and morale reports.
        ◦ Wellesley’s southern correspondents warned Hill (Wellington’s subordinate) of French maneuvers.

Funding & Logistics
    • Secret Service Funds limited:
        ◦ Stuart: ~£300/month for Bayonne operations.
        ◦ Couriers (Madrid → Lisbon) could cost £160.
    • Cost restricted long-term network expansion.
    • Networks were short-lived but efficient, especially during critical campaigns (e.g., Torres Vedras, 1810–11).
3. The Impact of Strategic Intelligence: Planning the 1812 Campaign
1. Nature and Integration of Intelligence
    • Strategic intelligence (civilian):
        ◦ Provided a broad picture of French forces, strength, and reinforcements.
        ◦ Alone, it had limited immediate impact—useful mainly for reassurance and planning.
        ◦ Gathered by civilian networks under Stuart and Wellesley.
    • Operational intelligence (military):
        ◦ Collected by Wellington’s own intelligence organisation (subordinates and officers).
        ◦ Focused on local, tactical, and short-term military movements.
        ◦ Lacked the wider strategic scope of civilian intelligence.
    • Integration and synergy:
        ◦ Combining both created a comprehensive view of the Peninsula theatre.
        ◦ Enabled Wellington to conceptualise all opposing forces and plan accordingly.

2. Post–Torres Vedras Context (1811)
    • Torres Vedras Campaign ended in a stalemate on the Portuguese frontier.
    • Strategic intelligence revealed that:
        ◦ The French were too strong to attack directly.
        ◦ Their centre of gravity was the ability to concentrate forces (Marmont, Soult, Cafarelli).
    • Wellington’s insight:
        ◦ If he could keep French armies divided, he could defeat them individually.
        ◦ Intelligence would be vital in deciding when and where to strike.

3. Planning for 1812
    • Wellington aimed to capture Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz (“keys to Spain”).
    • Problem (1811):
        ◦ Failures were due to French concentration of forces.
    • Solution (1812):
        ◦ Keep Marmont and Soult separated long enough for a swift siege and capture.
        ◦ Required:
            ▪ Operational foresight
            ▪ Integration of intelligence
            ▪ Understanding of terrain and seasons (Jan–June 1812)

4. Strategic Intelligence in Decision-Making (Early 1812)
Two main uses:
    1. Target selection:
        ◦ Civilian intelligence revealed overall French strength, letting Wellington identify the weakest point to strike.
    2. Enemy logistics:
        ◦ Madrid agents reported French supply shortages.
        ◦ Combined with topographical data (harvest zones), this allowed Wellington to predict enemy movements (where armies would forage).
        ◦ Helped decide between advancing against Soult (Andalusia) or against Marmont (Castile).

5. French Reinforcement & Withdrawal Situation (Late 1811–Early 1812)
    • Reinforcements:
        ◦ Only ~12,000 arrived Aug–Dec 1811 (mostly to Suchet in Aragón).
        ◦ Civilian reports showed few troops entering Spain; Napoleon distracted by Russia.
        ◦ By May 1812, fewer than 15,000 reinforcements had entered in 8 months.
    • Withdrawals:
        ◦ Napoleon recalled troops (esp. the Imperial Guard) for the Russian campaign.
        ◦ Civilian intelligence tracked troop movements north from Valladolid → Burgos → France.
        ◦ Over 34,000 men withdrew Mar–Apr 1812.
    • Consequences:
        ◦ French armies left understrength, poorly coordinated, and overstretched.
        ◦ Guerrilla activity increased; communications broke down.
        ◦ Wellington fully aware of French weakness through civilian reporting.

6. Movements of Marmont’s Army
    • October 1811: Marmont withdrew from the Portuguese border toward the interior (Salamanca → Valladolid → Toledo).
    • 12,000 troops (1st & 3rd divisions) detached to reinforce Suchet in Valencia.
    • This enabled Wellington to besiege and capture Ciudad Rodrigo successfully.
    • When Marmont learned of this, he halted the troop transfer and reconcentrated northward (early Jan 1812).

7. Wellington’s Use of Intelligence in Planning
    • He analysed combined intelligence to form accurate assumptions:
        ◦ French divisions’ movements confirmed Imperial Guard withdrawal and enemy distraction.
        ◦ Realised French forces limited by forage and supply availability.
    • Civilian reports noted the “exhausted state of the enemy’s resources in the Interior.”
    • Strategy:
        ◦ Wait until French unable to concentrate before striking.
        ◦ Base campaign timing on harvest cycles (logistical realities).

8. Strategic Options: Andalusia vs. Castile
    • Initial plan: invade Andalusia after Badajoz’s fall.
    • Problem: Ciudad Rodrigo not provisioned—forced return north.
    • Reasoning against Andalusia:
        ◦ In spring, French could not subsist; in summer, harvest gave them freedom to move.
        ◦ Moving south would allow Marmont to follow with superior numbers and access rich supplies.
    • Soult vs. Marmont:
        ◦ Soult: 56,000 troops but many tied down (Cadiz blockade, garrisons, Ballesteros).
        ◦ Marmont: ~22,000 in Salamanca + 20,000 foragers—more mobile and offensive-capable.
    • Decision: Stay north, fix Marmont in poor country (Castile), exploit his logistical weaknesses.

9. Wellington’s Operational Logic
    • By remaining in Castile:
        ◦ The Allies could exploit delayed harvests → maintain supply advantage.
        ◦ Could strike decisively before French could regroup.
    • His 1812 advance plan:
        ◦ Based on timing, intelligence integration, and environmental awareness.
        ◦ Sought to bring Marmont to a general battle under unfavourable conditions for the French.

*what drove the English Governments need for intelligence in the 1850s*

What drove the English government’s need for intelligence in the 1580s?
    • While Queen Elizabeth I believed the divine right of monarchy was still her best defence, the idea was revolting to her
    • Pushed by the Privy Council and the Common’s, she allowed Mary Queen of Scots to be beheaded
    • ‘By secret means they had uncovered her correspondence with Anthony Babington and his fellow conspirators, unearthing with great patience the evidence they needed to prove Mary's complicity in a plot to murder Elizabeth.’
    • ‘They dabbled a little in forgery. Even at the time the word entrapment was used by their enemies to describe the way Mary had been caught and held fast’
    • King Philip of Spain was more ambivalent about Mary’s execution for it left open his claim to the tudor crown.
    • ‘The outrage of Europe's Catholics was for Philip an instrument of political power. They believed that England was a heretic pariah kingdom where for nearly thirty years Elizabeth's government of atheists had engaged in a vicious persecution of English Catholics, raiding their homes, putting them in prison and making martyrs of their priests on trumped-up charges of treason.’
    • With preparations for an invading naval armada in fact already under way, there was at last a reality to the notion of toppling the Elizabethan regime by a Spanish invasion.
    • After Mary Queen of Scots died, a question of English succession arose, as Mary was previously seen as the de facto heir
    • ‘Whatever English succession law might say, everyone – even Elizabeth's advisers - knew that there was no other plausible candidate. But Mary had always been more than a successor waiting in the wings for her cousin to die of natural causes.’
    • Despite other claimants elsewhere, the main threat to Elizabeth was Spain
    • So by appealing to genealogy, to history and to the urgent politicsof Europe Allen and Persons sought to encourage Philip to commit himself to the great Enterprise of England.
    • All the plots, conspiracies and plans for invasion discovered in the 15 Sos by Burghley
and Walsingham gave cumulative weight to the feeling of dangerous emergency. And behind all of these conspiracies, in some way or fashion, were the two constants of Mary Queen of Scots and King Philipof Spain
    • Long and short of it, a protestant queen was effectively viewed as an enemy to every catholic ruler in Europe, with Spain seeking to act on it
    • Two critical years in the irrevocable breakdown of relations between Spain and England were those of I 584 and I 585. In October of the first year Lord Burghley wrote in a policy paper that his queen had 'many just causes to think that the King of Spain mindeth to
invade her realm and to destroy her person.’
        ◦ This was based upon the continued Spanish military presence in the Low Countries (Netherlands/Belgium) to destroy protestant resistance
        ◦ The second was the assassination of William of Nassau under King Philips Orders	
            ▪ William - Leader of Dutch Resistance to Spain
    • ‘The Great Armada of Spain was probably the worst-kept secret in sixteenth-century Europe. Philip's government was notoriously leaky’
    • . And yet it was vital nevertheless for Elizabeth's Privy Council to have reliable information of Spain's intentions. As ever, the problem was one of finding out the truth of
what was really happening from the heavy fug of rumour and report.
    • Many intelligence reports where just plainly wrong
    • ‘n January r 5 86, for example, some sailors arrived back in England talking of rumours of great Spanish naval preparations in Lisbon. The report, Walsingham wrote, was 'but a Spanish brag': it was simply a boast.’
    • By now, after practising his technique in the Babington Plot, Thomas Phelippes was adept both before and after the Armada at using double agents to extract information from Catholic exiles in mainland Europe.
    • One exile was Thomas Barnes, cousin of Gilbert Gifford, who established a correspondence with English exile Charles Paget.
    • ‘Paget believed that Barnes was his agent and sent questions for Barnes to answer in England about political and military affairs. In this way, with some skill and cunning, it was possible for Phelippes to find out what Paget and his Spanish masters
knew about the state of England and its preparedness for a naval
assault’
    • Also allowed Phelippes to send false information
    • As significant as Phelippes's system of double-cross was the intelligence
The impending Spanish Armada and fears of Catholic reprisal after the beheading of Mary Queen of Scot’s, dramatically pushed forward England’s intelligence gathering practices in the 1500s.

## Thomas Cruso and the Origins of Early Modern Intelligence

Context and Purpose

Thomas Cruso’s writings reflect early modern England’s understanding of intelligence and communication during the 17th century.

His work highlights the embryonic stage of organised intelligence, before the establishment of formal state institutions such as MI5 or MI6.

Forms of Intelligence

Intelligence was largely ad hoc, relying on personal networks, correspondence, and diplomacy rather than permanent bureaucratic structures.

Information gathering centred on letters, informants, and travellers, which created a slow and unreliable flow of intelligence.

The Role of Diplomats and Clergy

Diplomats functioned as dual agents — both political negotiators and gatherers of strategic information.

Clergy and scholars, valued for their literacy and contacts, were often used for deciphering codes or analysing correspondence.

Impact on Statecraft

Cruso’s era saw intelligence as an extension of diplomacy and divine providence — a moral and political duty rather than a professional craft.

The English state’s use of espionage, postal interception, and cipher-breaking laid the foundations for later institutional intelligence.

This period demonstrated the fusion of moral, political, and military motives in early intelligence work.

Limitations

Intelligence lacked central coordination and clear distinction between foreign and domestic affairs.

Information was often outdated by the time it reached decision-makers, limiting its immediate tactical value.

## Huw Davies, “Diplomats as Spymasters: A Case Study of the Peninsular War, 1809–1813”

Historical Context and Continuity

Davies situates the Peninsular War within a long evolution of British intelligence, from Walsingham’s Elizabethan networks to the gradual institutionalisation of the 19th–20th centuries.

Intelligence collection remained diplomatic rather than military, intended for strategic guidance rather than battlefield tactics.

The Peninsular War as a Turning Point

Britain’s sustained land campaign in Spain and Portugal made intelligence operationally crucial.

Lord Wellington relied on information from diplomats Charles Stuart (Lisbon) and Henry Wellesley (Cádiz), who built civilian spy networks to support military planning.

These efforts bridged the gap between ad hoc diplomacy and the later formalisation of intelligence services.

Organisation and Networks

Intelligence was gathered through a hierarchy of:

Correspondents – local informants reporting on enemy presence (cheap but unreliable).

Agents – paid intermediaries managing mini-networks (more mobile and dependable).

Spies – used for covert disruption but often ineffective.

Networks were divided geographically:

Stuart covered Portugal and northern Spain,

Wellesley handled southern and eastern Spain, aided by Spanish officials like Eusebio de Bardají and agents such as Manuel Sobral.

Communication and Logistics

Reports travelled slowly by courier (often weeks), yet intelligence remained timely enough for strategic use.

Funding from Secret Service accounts was limited, forcing networks to operate economically and intermittently.

Strategic Impact and 1812 Campaign

Civilian intelligence revealed French troop strengths, reinforcements, and logistical weaknesses.

When integrated with Wellington’s operational intelligence, it allowed:

anticipation of enemy moves,

informed target selection (Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz),

and timing of campaigns around French supply shortages and harvest cycles.

Wellington used intelligence to divide French forces, avoid direct confrontation, and win decisive engagements.

Legacy and Significance

The Peninsular system showed the value of decentralised, flexible intelligence coordinated between diplomats and the military.

Though still informal, it prefigured the institutionalisation of intelligence in the later 19th century.

The model resurfaced in the Crimean War, proving the adaptability of Wellington’s civilian–military approach.



# Stephen Alford, The Watchers: A Secret History of the Reign of Elizabeth I (2012), Chapter 16
## What Drove the English Government’s Need for Intelligence in the 1580s

Political and Religious Background

The execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1587) fundamentally reshaped England’s political and security landscape.

Although Elizabeth I resisted killing a fellow monarch, pressure from the Privy Council and Parliament forced her hand.

Mary’s involvement in the Babington Plot—a Catholic conspiracy to assassinate Elizabeth—was uncovered by Walsingham’s intelligence network through intercepted correspondence, coded letters, and partial forgery.

This episode demonstrated the power of espionage and entrapment in securing the Protestant regime.

Religious and International Tensions

Mary’s death made King Philip II of Spain both politically emboldened and morally justified (in Catholic eyes) to act against England.

Across Europe, England was portrayed as a heretic state persecuting Catholics, fuelling anti-English sentiment.

The Catholic exiles and Jesuit missionaries, backed by Spain, became perceived as agents of subversion.

Elizabeth’s government now faced a real external and internal Catholic threat, heightening the need for continuous intelligence.

The Spanish Threat

By the mid-1580s, Spanish military activity in the Low Countries and the assassination of William of Orange (1584) under Philip’s orders signalled open hostility.

English policymakers (notably Lord Burghley) believed invasion was imminent, citing multiple plots and Spain’s growing naval power.

The Spanish Armada (launched 1588) became the focus of intelligence operations; though widely known, England still required accurate, timely confirmation of Spanish intentions amid a sea of misinformation and rumour.

Intelligence Operations and Methods

Francis Walsingham expanded his network across Europe, relying on codebreakers and double agents.

Thomas Phelippes, master cryptographer, perfected double-agent techniques, turning Catholic exiles (e.g., Thomas Barnes and Charles Paget) into sources of intelligence and disinformation.

The network’s dual purpose:

Gather real intelligence on Spanish plans and Catholic conspiracies.

Feed false intelligence back to confuse and mislead England’s enemies.

Outcome and Legacy

The Babington Plot and Armada crisis institutionalised intelligence as a core function of Elizabethan governance.

Surveillance, interception, and counter-espionage became essential tools of national defence.

The 1580s thus marked the transformation of espionage from ad hoc diplomacy into systematic state security, laying early foundations for later British intelligence practice.
