**Ferris, John, ‘Intelligence’, in The Cambridge History of the Second World War. 
Volume I, Fighting the War , ed. by John Robert Ferris and Evan Mawdsley 
(Cambridge University Press, 2015), pp. 637–63**


*Today, the evidence is strong, despite the destruction or
withholding of records on Soviet, and particularly Japanese, intelligence.
However, that evidence has not been assessed thoroughly by specialists,
nor incorporated into broader accounts of the war* - [637]

*The story also is told uncritically, from the perspective of Allied sword against Axis shield, 
at the peak of the success of ULTRA. Actually, the intelligence war was a real
competition, involving Axis successes and Allied failures. Axis intelligence
services ranged from incompetent to good, mostly mediocre. Allied ones
were poor to great, mostly good.* - essentially stating the view of the Allied powers being the leading force 
and the Axis being underplayed in their significance [637]


Whilst both sides had good intelligence that mostly matched each other the British, American and Soviet problem was 
the money it cost to exploit this issue and failures of assessment exposed them to the Axis surpise attacks. 


**Intelligence** - *Intelligence is the collection, collation and analysis of evidence to enable an
effective and efficient use of scarce resources. Intelligence is not a form of
power, but rather a means to guide its use. Intelligence does not win wars. It
does help generals do so. It involves finding true and useful secrets while
avoiding false notions, and forcing the opposite on the foe, through security
and deception. Intelligence is collected through open and secret sources, each
with power and limits.* - [637]


Intelligence didnt win the war for the Allies but it shaped its victory [637/638]


page 638 basically says that intelligence isnt what wins wars but it is a factor - you wont win with that alone 



*From 1942, however, the Allies rapidly became stronger
than their foes, and better in most military spheres. In this match, intelligence
routinely served as force-multiplier and often as tiebreaker. It shaped the
Second World War more than the First, because intelligence supported
firepower which could kill and move, enabling more decisive actions, the
effect was one-sided for a long time, and one side devoted far greater
resources to the task* - [642]


greatest impact of intelligence was in operations [642]



*ULTRA, the code word for high-grade Anglo-American
communications intelligence against Germany, Italy and Japan* [643]


*In 1939–41, intelligence was a low secondary strength for the Axis. From
1942, it became a high secondary strength for the Western Allies, and during
1943, a low but rising one for the USSR, as intelligence guided the big
battalions* - [645]






*The best intelligence is useless without efficient links between the organs which collect, 
evaluate and act upon it… A good army with bad information can beat a bad army with 
good intelligence* [638]





*Stalin and Hitler used intelligence in ways poorly suited to war. Neither
wished to hear contrary analyses from subordinates, merely echoes of their
own opinions. Both wanted intelligence to provide just facts, which they
filtered through ideology, personal preconceptions and the belief that their
will created reality. Stalin and Hitler, overconfident micromanagers, created
top-down systems where they tried to control all actions.* [648]




*Before Operation BARBAROSSA, Stalin told his military intelli-
gence chief, Filipp Golikov, that any reports about a German attack on the
USSR were false, the product of officers trapped by British deception. Despite
the personal risk, Golikov did present reports of danger to Stalin. On 22 June
1941, in any case, the world bit back* [648]



*ULTRA was the greatest source of intelligence during this war, but never
perfect. It took words straight from the enemy’s mouth, but rarely were they
straightforward. Its value differed with time and theatre. ULTRA became
more successful and useful over time, but its history was replete with reversals
of fortune. The Allies never read every important enemy message, or most of
them.* [649]


aircraft changed war but this seems to suggest more through firepower than through intelligence - [651]


*Communications intelligence, backed by radar and traffic analysis, created new forms of maritime war, centred on distant and precise attack against soft targets.* [651]


*Across the Pacific, ULTRA of lesser quality than in Europe enabled greater operational triumphs, because conditions on the battlefield gave intelligence a more dramatic effect. Intelligence affected this war more than any other in history* [660] - reinforced idea that this doesnt win wars but is impactful 


*Intelligence let bold American leaders use their forces to ambush Japanese fleets twice, in the Battles of Coral Sea and Midway… in one case scoring a tie and in the other a triumph – the exchange of four Japanese for one American carrier* [661]
