*Today, the evidence is strong, despite the destruction or
withholding of records on Soviet, and particularly Japanese, intelligence.
However, that evidence has not been assessed thoroughly by specialists,
nor incorporated into broader accounts of the war* - [637]

*The story also is told uncritically, from the perspective of Allied sword against Axis shield, 
at the peak of the success of ULTRA. Actually, the intelligence war was a real
competition, involving Axis successes and Allied failures. Axis intelligence
services ranged from incompetent to good, mostly mediocre. Allied ones
were poor to great, mostly good.* - essentially stating the view of the Allied powers being the leading force 
and the Axis being underplayed in their significance [637]


Whilst both sides had good intelligence that mostly matched each other the British, American and Soviet problem was 
the money it cost to exploit this issue and failures of assessment exposed them to the Axis surpise attacks.
