# To what extent can cultural phenomena be blamed for the rise in anti-social and criminal behaviour in modern Britain and America? 

`Post 1950 focus`

# Section 1 - *Cinema*
---

Both recognise cultural impact of cinema on subcultures
- creating moral panic

### historically blamed cinema for bad examples to the working class

"veritable textbook of bad examples to the young, the easily influenced, the working class" (p. 171).


 "the larger the audience, the lower the moral mass resistance to suggestion" (p. 176).


### media doesnt report crime but stereotypes it and creates moral panic

"actors concerned are pictured in a highly stereotypical way" (p. 11)

"Folk Devils" who are "visible reminders of what we should not be" (p. 2).

"focuses upon what is out of place... to represent order" (p. 2).


### rise in crime is often actually a rise in reporting of crime to sell papers

"Sensational and emotive reportage has become more important as newspapers fight to retain their readership" (p. 201).

"banal science" (p. 152)

"mass unemployment, the decay of communal life... and the evaporation of hope" (p. 167).


# Section 2 - *Sports Hooliganism (Football and Ice Hockey)*
---

Blamed for creating a *culture of violence*

### Hooligans treated as a modern folk devil symbolising social decline

"rapid oscillation from one such devil to another... the soccer hooligan, the hippy, the skinhead" (p. 3).

 "repressive legislation" like the 1994 Criminal Justice Act (p. 318).

"LA-style girl gang culture" (p. 105)

### Hooliganism isnt a new cultural phenomena its a stable feature of British history

"stable feature of a changing society" (p. 615).

"convenient metaphor for wider social tensions" (p. 615)

"real social issues... unemployment, shabby entertainment, racism and poor housing" (p. 616).


### Violence within these groups is usually a survival mechanism in the face of poverty not copying the media

"functional adaptation to an uncompromising social environment" (p. 231)

where the gang replaces the family and school (p. 171).

"demolition of nearly all of Chicago’s public housing" (p. 28) 

which "shattered" the social order (p. 43).

# Section 3 - *Fashion and Consumerism*
---

"Culture and Commerce" of specific urban fashions—often linked to **Gangsta Rap**—were similarly blamed for promoting a "gang" lifestyle.

### The new right argues that a specific culture (fashion) is responsible for crime

"underclass" is defined by "illegitimacy, violent crime, and drop-out from the labour force" (p. 163)

"rational choices" to rely on welfare (p. 136).

"lens through which to view the poor—as undeserving, deviant, dangerous" (p. 102).


### It is not the style of fashion that causes crime but the pressure to own it in an unequal society that does

Consumerism cultivates "insatiable desire" (p. 551)

where the lack of goods is felt as a "state of humiliation" (p. 548).

"consumer riots"—an attempt to join the "ideology of consumer capitalism" (p. 554).


### People turn to crime to afford these fashions because the legitimate economy has rejected them

"sharply stratified labour market" (p. 82)

"systematically excluded" inner-city youths (p. 82).
