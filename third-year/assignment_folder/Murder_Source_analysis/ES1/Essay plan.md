# To what extent can cultural phenomena be blamed for the rise in anti-social and criminal behaviour in modern Britain and America? 

`Post 1950 focus`

# Section 1 - *Cinema*
---

Both recognise cultural impact of cinema on subcultures
- creating moral panic

### historically blamed cinema for bad examples to the working class

"veritable textbook of bad examples to the young, the easily influenced, the working class" (p. 171).


 "the larger the audience, the lower the moral mass resistance to suggestion" (p. 176).


### media doesnt report crime but stereotypes it and creates moral panic

"actors concerned are pictured in a highly stereotypical way" (p. 11)

"Folk Devils" who are "visible reminders of what we should not be" (p. 2).

"focuses upon what is out of place... to represent order" (p. 2).


### rise in crime is often actually a rise in reporting of crime to sell papers

"Sensational and emotive reportage has become more important as newspapers fight to retain their readership" (p. 201).

"banal science" (p. 152)

"mass unemployment, the decay of communal life... and the evaporation of hope" (p. 167).

# Section 2 -- Expanded to US/UK

### **Part 1: The UK Argument (The Hooligan as a Distraction)**

Focus on how the State uses the "Hooligan" to distract from poverty._

1. **The Point:** Start by stating that British society constantly invents new "devils" to represent social decline. It isn’t about the specific group; it’s about finding a target.
    
    - **The Note to use:** This is the "rapid oscillation from one such devil to another... the soccer hooligan, the hippy, the skinhead" **(Cohen, p. 3)**.
        
2. **The Point:** Argue that "Hooliganism" is not a new problem caused by violent movies or bad culture. It has always been there.
    
    - **The Note to use:** It is a "stable feature of a changing society" **(Pearson, p. 615)**.
        
3. **The Point:** Explain _why_ the State focuses on them. It is a trick to make people look at the "thugs" instead of the government's failures.
    
    - **The Note to use:** It serves as a "convenient metaphor for wider social tensions" **(Pearson, p. 615)**.
        
4. **The Point:** Identify what those failures really are. The problem isn't "culture," it is economics.
    
    - **The Note to use:** The real issues are "unemployment, shabby entertainment, racism and poor housing" **(Pearson, p. 616)**.
        
5. **The Point:** Conclude the UK side by showing how the government attacks the _symptom_ (the people) rather than the _cause_ (the poverty). They pass laws to ban the lifestyle.
    
    - **The Note to use:** This leads to "repressive legislation" like the **1994 Criminal Justice Act** (p. 318).

### **Part 2: The US Argument (The Gang as Survival)**

 Contrast it with the UK: this isn't about symbols/laws, it's about physical survival._

1. **The Point:** Switch to the US. Here, the violence isn't a "style" or a "rebellion" like in the UK. It is a logical reaction to a destroyed environment.
    
    - **The Note to use:** Violence is a "functional adaptation to an uncompromising social environment" **(Spergel, p. 231)**.
	    - "These kids aren't violent because they are crazy or influenced by movies; they are violent because it is the only tool that works to keep them safe in a broken world."
        
2. **The Point:** Explain that when the State removes support systems (schools/families), the gang fills the void.
    
    - **The Note to use:** It occurs where "the gang replaces the family and school" **(Spergel, p. 171)**.
	    - occurring in spaces where the gang performs cultural and economic functions **"no longer adequately performed by the family, the school, and the labor market"**
        
3. **The Point:** Give the specific evidence. The State didn't just ignore these areas; they actively destroyed the buildings.
    
    - **The Note to use:** This was driven by the "demolition of nearly all of Chicago’s public housing" **(Aspholm, p. 28)**.
        
4. **The Point:** Conclude by saying this physical destruction is what caused the chaos, not "culture."
    
    - **The Note to use:** This destruction "shattered" the social order **(Aspholm, p. 43)**.

# Section 3: Structural Roots and the "Limited Extent"

_Focus: Arguing that "Fashion," consumerism, and the "Underclass" are symptoms of economic exclusion and state control._

### **Part 1: The UK Argument (Consumerism as the Driver)**

_Focus: It is not "gang culture" that drives crime, but the desperate need to participate in consumer capitalism (Fashion/Brands)._

1. **The Point:** Start by introducing the "Underclass" label. The UK adopted this idea to suggest that poverty is caused by "character flaws" rather than the economy.
    
    - **The Note to use:** The dominant image became "one of people with serious character flaws... who have only themselves to blame" **(Welshman, p. 141)**.
        
2. **The Point:** Argue that the real driver of youth crime isn't a rejection of society, but an _obsession_ with its values (Consumerism). Capitalism creates a constant hunger for new things.
    
    - **The Note to use:** Consumerism cultivates an "insatiable desire" which is essential for the economy but causes crime **(Hayward & Smith, p. 551)**.
        
3. **The Point:** Explain the emotional impact. For young people, not having the right "fashion" or brands isn't just annoying—it is shameful.
    
    - **The Note to use:** The lack of goods is felt as a "state of humiliation" **(Hayward & Smith, p. 548)**.
        
4. **The Point:** Use the **2011 Riots** as the proof. These weren't political protests or "gang wars"; they were people smashing windows to get the products they were told they needed.
    
    - **The Note to use:** The riots should be understood as **"consumer riots"**—an attempt to join the "ideology of consumer capitalism" **(Hayward & Smith, p. 554)**.

### **Part 2: The US Argument (Exclusion from the Economy)**

_Focus: It is not a "culture of laziness" (Murray), but a "stratified labour market" (Garland) that forces people into crime._

1. **The Point:** Switch to the US context. Here, the argument is often that the poor make a "choice" to be poor or criminal (The New Right view).
    
    - **The Note to use:** Murray argues they make **"rational choices"** to rely on welfare because it pays better than low-wage work **(Welshman, p. 136)**.
        
2. **The Point:** Explain how the State uses this "culture" argument to punish the poor instead of helping them.
    
    - **The Note to use:** Crime acts as a **"lens through which to view the poor—as undeserving, deviant, dangerous"** **(Garland, p. 102)**.
        
3. **The Point:** Counter this with the structural reality. The economy changed ("Late Modernity"), and the good jobs disappeared.
    
    - **The Note to use:** This created a **"sharply stratified labour market"** with fewer ties between the rich and poor **(Garland, p. 82)**.
        
4. **The Point:** Conclude by showing that inner-city youth aren't "dropping out" of work; they are being locked out.
    
    - **The Note to use:** Whole sectors of the population have been **"systematically excluded"** from the labour market **(Garland, p. 82)**.
