###  **Barker, M., and J. Petley, eds,** _Ill Effects: The Media/Violence Debate_, 2nd edn (London: Routledge, 2001).

"This simple image of direct effects draws its power from a deep reservoir of social fear and dogma which first formed in the mid-nineteenth century as commentators began to link the social costs of modernity with the proliferation of new forms of popular entertainment." (p. 150)

"Now violence and terror lurk in the once-safe streets. The family no longer holds its proper place and parents have abandoned their responsibilities." (p. 151)

"The result was banal science, which failed to ask awkward questions, to pursue other possible lines of inquiry or to place 'effects' in their social contexts." (p. 152)

 "Nevertheless, we cannot agree with the conclusion usually taken for granted in these cases, that the reading and the robbery stand in the relation of cause and effect." (p. 158)

"From its inception the cinema has been regarded by moral entrepreneurs as a cause of decline and deterioration, and as a veritable textbook of bad examples to the young, the easily influenced, the working class." (p. 171)


"the larger the audience, the lower the moral mass resistance to suggestion" (p. 176)

"The fact is that crowded slums, machine labour...barren lives, starved emotions...are far more dangerous to morals, property and life than...any motion picture." (p. 160)

"If we are to understand and respond constructively to social violence in contemporary Britain we need to place it in the context of the massive social and psychic disruptions set in motion by mass unemployment, the decay of communal life and public space, and the evaporation of hope." (p. 167)

"the 'video nasty' issue was deliberately and explicitly used as an illustration of the dangers of the so-called 'underclass'." (p. 179)



### **Cohen, S.,** _Folk Devils and Moral Panics: The Creation of the Mods and Rockers_, 3rd edn (London: Routledge, 2011).

"A condition, episode, person or group of persons emerges to become defined as a threat to societal values and interests; its nature is presented in a stylized and stereotypical fashion by the mass media; the moral barricades are manned by editors, bishops, politicians and other right-thinking people." (p. 1)

 "The student of moral enterprise cannot but pay particular attention to the role of the mass media in defining and shaping social problems." (p. 9)
 
 "This information characteristically is not received at first hand, it tends to be processed in such a form that the action or actors concerned are pictured in a highly stereotypical way." (p. 11)
 
 "Disproportionality - an exaggeration of the number or strength of the cases, in terms of the damage caused, moral offensiveness, potential risk if ignored. Public concern is not directly proportionate to objective harm." (p. xxvii)


### **Ericson, R. V., P. M. Baranek, and J. B. L. Chan,** _Representing Order: Crime, Law and Justice in the News Media_ (Milton Keynes: Open University Press, 1991).

"The news institution focuses upon what is out of place: the deviant, equivocal and unpredictable... and works to provide a set of classifications which 'establish the normal, reduce equivocality and increase predictability—that is, to represent order'." (p. 2)

"the media are not simply the mouthpieces of their sources as has often been claimed. On the contrary, the media are powerful and frequently have the upper-hand in defining the news." (p. 2)

"Conceptually, the news media are perceived as agencies which scan organizational activities in their endless search for signs of deviance." (p. 1)

"the space available for participation in the public sphere has been bought out by the public-relations machines of the corporate and governmental conglomerates" (p. 2)

Bad news was found to constitute between 45% and 72% of the total output of the outlets during the sample period." (p. 3)

"letters to the editor tend to be chosen in order to bolster 'the newspaper's image and public acceptance'" (p. 2)




###  **Rowbotham, J., K. Stevenson, and S. Pegg,** _Crime News in Modern Britain: Press Reporting and Responsibility, 1820-2010_ (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2013).

"Decisions on the presentation of crime narratives and representations of the perspectives taken by various titles set the framework through which we learn to understand the realities of the everyday legal world." (p. 2)

"The media do not just transmit neutral information; they present a particular set of images about what the social world should be like." (p. 10)

"Both the issues involved and the actors in a crime drama are now packaged into a series of stereotypes which lack both complexity and a sense of how these relate to the effective delivery of justice." (p. 181)

"...understanding this is crucial to a comprehension of the moral panic surrounding the Leveson Inquiry and its 2013 Report (for moral panic, in Cohenian terms, we certainly believe it will come to be labelled)." (p. 2)

"Using sensationalised and ideologically framed rhetoric... claiming the imperative of public interest, this has led to a series of panics linked to stories such as the murder of Sarah Payne." (p. 173)

Sensational and emotive reportage has become more important as newspapers fight to retain their readership... This fast-paced delivery brings with it the danger of inaccuracy, particularly given the loss of specialist legal commentators." (p. 201)

"Labour, for instance, successfully positioned itself as the ‘law-and-order’ party, wresting that title from the Conservatives, by promising to be ‘tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime’." (p. 176)

"The same apparent helplessness in the face of consistently high levels of juvenile crime... was evident in the mid-twentieth century, with similar causes, from inappropriate reading matter to bad parenting and poor environments, being suggested." (p. 169)

The accusation was that there was no will to remedy the system because it gave employment to 'Judges, Sheriffs, Criers, Barristers, Lawyers... and all the other machinery relating to crime'." (p. 19)



### **Thompson, K.,** _Moral Panics_ (London: Routledge, 1998).

"Newspaper headlines continually warn of some new danger resulting from moral laxity, and television programmes echo the theme with sensational documentaries." **(p. 1)**

"Britain is exceptional for the extent to which it has national mass media that are highly concentrated and closely linked... the London-based national newspapers are dominant." **(p. 25-26)**

"Concentrated media attention confers the status of high public concern on issues which are highlighted; these generally become understood by everyone as the 'pressing issues of the day'." **(p. 58)**

"The mass media operate with certain definitions of what is newsworthy... There are built-in factors... to structured ideological biases, which predispose the media to make a certain event into news." **(p.35)**

### **Cohen, S.,** _Folk Devils and Moral Panics: The Creation of the Mods and Rockers_, 3rd edn (London: Routledge, 2011).

"In the gallery of types that society erects to show its members which roles should be avoided and which should be emulated, these groups have occupied a constant position as folk devils: visible reminders of what we should not be." **(p. 2)**

"These years witnessed rapid oscillation from one such devil to another: the Mod, the Rocker, the Greaser, the student militant, the drug fiend, the vandal, the soccer hooligan, the hippy, the skinhead." **(p. 3)**

"The Mods and Rockers are one of the many sets of figures through which the sixties in Britain will be remembered... the Mods and Rockers stand alongside the Profumo affair, the Great Train Robbery... as the types and scenes of the sixties." **(p. 3)**



### **Thompson, K.,** _Moral Panics_ (London: Routledge, 1998).

"The Mods and Rockers symbolized something far more important than what they actually did. They touched the delicate and ambivalent nerves through which post-war social change in Britain was experienced." **(p. 40)**

"As with the Mods and Rockers of the 1960s, the tabloid media, police and moral establishment rapidly sought ways to condemn and control these latter-day folk-devils." **(p. 50)**

"The probation service and ex-offender organizations found themselves bombarded with requests from journalists seeking out case histories to illustrate this apparent explosion of LA-style girl gang culture on the streets of Britain." **(p. 105)**

"The discourse had all the elements required to generate a moral panic: suggestions of a spreading risk from out-of-control folk devils—in this case, teenage girls acting against their feminine nature and behaving like men." **(p. 108)**

"Girl gangs may be just a symptom of a wider malaise produced as the taboos of female violence and vulgarity are breached in all walks of life." **(p. 106)**



### Williamson, Howard, review of _Hooligan: A History of Respectable Fears_, by Geoffrey Pearson, _Sociology_, 17.4 (1983), 614–16

"Pearson attempts, and fails, to trace such a time... He accuses writers, politicians and social commentators of a 'nostalgic amnesia' through which they romanticize the past." (p. 614)

"Jumping back twenty or thirty years at a time - from the black muggers of today, through the Teds of the '50s... right back to the 1600s - he examines the basis of respectable fears to do with law and disorder." (p. 615)

"Certainly such behaviour has historically been viewed as un-British, and non-British scapegoats - particularly blacks and Irish (the very word 'Hooligan' is of Irish origin) - have been identified as the source of this disruption." (p. 616)

"Crime and hooliganism, Pearson maintains, are in fact the stable features of a changing society." (p. 615)

"Preoccupations with mounting social disorder... have served as 'a convenient metaphor for wider social tensions which attend the advance of democratization'." (p. 615)

He insists that to focus on hooliganism... is to trivialize the real social issues of today - unemployment, shabby entertainment, racism and poor housing." (p. 616)



### Elteren, Mel van, review of _Youth in Britain since 1945_, by Bill Osgerby, _International Review of Social History_, 44.2 (1999), 317–19

"[The book examines] the post-war stereotyping of young people by moral authorities as the embodiment of both the best and the worst aspects of social and cultural change." (p. 317)

"Youth subcultures have always been intertwined with the institutions of the market in an ongoing relationship of exchange... rather than [being] autonomous grassroots cultures." (p. 318)

"It highlights the way in which a reformist spirit of rehabilitation and welfare was replaced, during the seventies and eighties, by a more punitive set of intervention strategies, as a change towards a more authoritarian form of political state took place." (p. 318)

"Moral panics regarding youth behaviour arose... political authorities met these developments by the passage of the 1994 Criminal Justice Act, according to the author 'one of the most repressive pieces of legislation to be introduced by a modern British government'." (p. 318)



### **Spergel, I. A.,** ‘Youth Gangs: Continuity and Change’, _Crime and Justice_, 12 (1990), 171–275.

"The gang is an important social institution for low-income male youths... because it often serves social, cultural, and economic functions no longer adequately performed by the family, the school, and the labor market." **(p. 171)**

"Race or ethnicity and social isolation interact with poverty and community disorganization to account for much of the gang problem." **(p. 171)**

"Few of these youths have experienced anything but severe economic deprivation... 'Survival through hustling or fighting is a functional adaptation to an uncompromising social environment'." **(p. 231)**

"Youth gangs are not unique to contemporary urban America. They have existed across time and cultures... Youth gangs tend to develop during times of rapid social change and political instability." **(p. 171)**

"Youth gangs may be an endemic feature of urban culture that varies over time in its form, social meaning, and antisocial character." **(p. 174)**

"Some Latin street gangs in southern California have existed within particular localities for two or more generations... 'Parents and in some cases even grandparents were members of the same gang. There is a sense of continuity of family identity'." **(p. 214)**


### **Aspholm, Roberto R., _Views from the Streets: The Transformation of Gangs and Violence on Chicago's South Side_ (New York: Columbia University Press, 2020)**

"The demolition of nearly all of Chicago’s public housing developments, then, not only served to eradicate many of the drug markets that had been the most profitable for the city’s street gangs, it also served to eliminate gang strongholds and disrupt long-standing gang networks." **(p. 28)**

"The arrival of thousands of gang members from demolished public housing developments into existing gang territories in other distressed black neighborhoods... frequently led to violent clashes within these receiving communities." **(p. 28)**

"The incarceration of increasing numbers of gang members and, especially, gang leaders also had the effect of weakening existing gang structures.... federal authorities 'went and locked all the heavies up.'" **(p. 31)**

"The collective weight of these circumstances effectively shattered the black street gangs on Chicago’s South Side during the first decade of the twenty-first century." **(p. 43)**

"Today’s gangs are organized very differently than—indeed, in many ways, in diametrical opposition to—their hierarchical, corporate-style predecessors." **(p. 17)**

"Formal positions of leadership at the neighborhood level have also been largely, if not universally, eliminated.... Chicago’s youthful African American gang members have established egalitarian arrangements based on a delicate balance of collectivist ideals, mutual respect, and personal autonomy." **(p. 48)**

"Aside from their mention of gang fracturing, this research bears out that everything in this statement is erroneous, and everything, including the alleged cause of gang fracturing, is manufactured to depict gang members as morally bankrupt savages." **(p. 76)**

"The black gangs on Chicago’s South Side today, moreover, are not really 'factions' at all, as this term implies that these independent neighborhood-based groups remain part of broader, coherent gang organizations that, in reality, no longer exist." **(p. 76)**

The findings from this study... indicate that gangs and violence on Chicago’s South Side are the products of a complex, interrelated set of conditions... particularly those related to marginalization and despair, poverty and economic exclusion, and pervasive community violence." **(p. 171)**

"Gangs provide... resistance identities that facilitate the reconstruction of dignity and self-esteem systematically undermined by a lifetime of marginalization and vilification." **(p. 171)**

### **Garland, David,** _The Culture of Control: Crime and Social Order in Contemporary Society_ (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001).

"The correlation between late modern social change and increased crime rates was no mere coincidence... the evidence strongly suggests a causal link between the coming of late modernity and society's increased susceptibility to crime." **(p. 90)**

"The high crime rates of the 1960s and 1970s were a precipitate of these social changes—an unplanned but altogether predictable product of the interaction of these elements." **(p. 91)**

"The consequence was a more sharply stratified labour market, with growing inequalities separating the top and bottom tiers... and ultimately, fewer ties of solidarity between these groups." **(p. 82)**

"Whole sectors of the population—particularly inner-city youths in poor or minority communities—were systematically excluded from the labour market just as many of their parents had been before them." **(p. 82)**

"In the political reaction against the welfare state and late modernity, crime acted as a lens through which to view the poor—as undeserving, deviant, dangerous, different." **(p. 102)**


### Hayward, Keith, and Oliver Smith, 'Crime and consumer culture', in _The Oxford Handbook of Criminology_, ed. by Alison Liebling, Shadd Maruna and Lesley McAra, 7th edn (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2023), pp. 542–64

"The crime-consumerism nexus asserts that consumerism cultivates—especially among young people—new forms of subjectivity based around desire, individualism, hedonism, and impulsivity, which, in many instances, can find expression in transgressive and even criminal behaviour." **(p. 550)**

"A unique feature of contemporary consumer culture is that insatiable desire is now not only normalized but essential to the very survival of the current socio-economic order... The criminogenic consequences of this 'strange combination of perpetual dissatisfaction and a longing for the new' hardly need spelling out." **(p. 551)**

"The structural predicament of the ghetto poor is not simply a deficit of goods... it is a state of humiliation." **(p. 548)**

"Consumer capitalism therefore relies upon a culture of competitive interpersonal relations to cultivate envy and a pervasive, deep-rooted sense of dissatisfaction." **(p. 553)**

"Thus, from an ultra-realist perspective, the 2011 London riots should be understood primarily as 'consumer riots'—that is, rather than seeking to challenge the established political orthodoxy, the rioters (in the main) illustrated a deep commitment to the ideology of consumer capitalism." **(p. 554)**


### Welshman, John, _Underclass: A History of the Excluded, 1880-2000_ (London: Hambledon Continuum, 2006)

"By the 1980s, the meaning of the term 'underclass' had changed significantly... The dominant image had become 'one of people with serious character flaws entrenched by a welfare subculture and who have only themselves to blame'." (p. 141)

"Murray argued that... 'The choices may be seen... as the behaviour of people responding to the reality of the world around them... rational choices'... The poor were encouraged to behave in ways that were advantageous in the short term but destructive in the long term."  (pp. 136, 134)

"Murray argued that 'latent poverty' (those who were below the official poverty line, plus those who were above it only because of welfare payments)... began to increase again after 1972... Calling this the 'most damning of statistics', Murray argued that economic independence was the key factor in determining the quality of a family's life." (pp.134-135)

"Macnicol identified five important underlying strands... First, he claimed it was an artificial 'administrative' definition... In this respect, it was a statistical artefact in that its size would be affected by such factors as eligibility, take-up of benefits, and changing levels of unemployment." (p. xix)

"The concept of an inter-generational underclass... has been reconstructed periodically over at least the past one hundred years... Underclass stereotypes have always been a part of the discourse on poverty in advanced industrial societies." (p. xix)

"The idea of the 'undeserving poor' and the stigmas with which people are labelled persist... because they are useful to the people who are not poor." (p. xvii)

"Katz has also suggested that the underclass is a 'metaphor for social transformation' and evokes perceptions of novelty, complexity, and danger." (p. xvii)
