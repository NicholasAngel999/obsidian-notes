Policing: Excerpt of Testimony by Mrs Lupe Marshall to the La Follette
Committee Investigating the Chicago Memorial Day Massacre, 1937.
Senator LA FOLLETTE. Were you successful in your efforts to get away from the
police?
Mrs. MARSHALL. No; I was not. After I evaded these policemen that were immediately
in front of me . . . . I was aware that my head was bleeding. I noticed that my blouse
was all stained with blood, and that sort of brought me to, and I started walking slowly
toward the direction from which a policeman had just clubbed an individual, and this
individual dragged himself a bit and tried to get up, when the policeman clubbed him
again. He did that four times.
Senator LA FOLLETTE. When he was on the ground?
Mrs. MARSHALL. While he was trying to get up. Every time he tried to get up the
policeman’s club came down on him. Then he took him by the foot and turned him
over. When the man finally fell so he could not move, the policeman took him by the
foot and turned him on his back, and started dragging him. As he turned over, I noticed
that the man’s shirt was all blood stained here on the side, so I screamed at the
policeman and said, “Don’t do that. Can’t you see he is terribly injured?” And at the
moment I said that, somebody struck me from the back again and knocked me down.
As I went down somebody kicked me on the side here, a policeman kicked me on the
side here.
Senator LA FOLLETTE. How can you be sure they were policemen?
Mrs. MARSHALL. Well, I could see from the sides. I could not identify the particular
policemen that did it, but I could see their uniforms, and I could see the edges, the
ends of the clubs from the side of my eyes.
Senator LA FOLLETTE. Go ahead.
Mrs. MARSHALL. So, after he kicked me I tried to get up, and they hit me three times
across the back, and then somebody picked me up and took me to the patrol wagon.
As we were walking along to the patrol wagon I noticed men lying all over the field.
Some of them were motionless. Some were groaning, but nearly all of those that were
lying down had their heads covered with blood, and their clothing was stained with
blood. They took me to one patrol wagon, and as I was walking toward it the policeman
is dragging me by the arm. As I was walking toward it, one man that I presumed was
a newspaper reporter asked my name...
Mrs. MARSHALL. ...and I said “Lupe Marshall”, and I gave him my address as quickly
as I could, and I was about to give him my telephone number when he twisted me
14
around and he said, “Come on, get going!” And as we approached the patrol wagon I
noticed that it was full, so they said, “No, we can’t get her in there.”
Then they took me to the other patrol wagon, and that patrol wagon was filled also, so
they took me to a distance and at that moment a patrol wagon drove in, or got into
position, but it was in motion, and it stopped right in front of us, and they opened the
door, and I was going to step in. I had one foot on the step when a policeman put his
hand on my back, on my buttocks, and shoved me in there, so that if I had not put my
hands across my face I would have struck the grating of the window in the front of the
patrol wagon in there. After I poised myself I walked over in the wagon and sat next to
the door, and observed out as much as I could. When the policemen started to pick
up those men that had been lying approximately where I had been standing when the
thing started, they started bringing them in by their feet and their hands, half dragging
them and half picking them up, and there was one man that they brought, the first one
that they put in the wagon, he was a heavy set fellow. He weighed about 200 pounds,
blonde fellow. They grabbed him, and shoved him in the wagon...and I noticed that he
had two red stains about the size of a penny, one on the upper side of his abdomen
and one lower, and immediately after that other policemen started bringing the other
wounded men, and that is the confusion in which they threw every one of the men that
were in the wagon with me. None of the men that were in the wagon with me were
able to sit up. None of them sat on the benches. I had to lift my feet up on to the bench
to allow them to put the men in there.
Senator LA FOLLETTE. Did they pile them one on top of another.
Mrs. MARSHALL. They piled them one on top of the other. There were some men who
had their heads underneath others. Some had their arms all twisted up, and their legs
twisted up, until they filled the wagon up, and one man said, “Well, I guess that’s all”,
and they shut the door.
Senator LA FOLLETTE. How many would you say were in the patrol wagon at this
time?
Mrs. MARSHALL. 16 men—16 men, besides myself.
Senator LA FOLLETTE. Were there any others seriously wounded in the wagon?
Mrs. MARSHALL. They were all seriously wounded. On the way to the hospital—
Senator LA FOLLETTE. Just a moment. Had any of them, could you see, received
any first aid?
Mrs. MARSHALL. No; none of them, because I saw where they were picking them up
from. They were picking them up from the original position in which they laid there.
They were bringing them into the wagon
