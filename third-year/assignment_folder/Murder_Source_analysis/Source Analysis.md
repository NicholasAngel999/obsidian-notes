Policing: Excerpt of Testimony by Mrs Lupe Marshall to the La Follette
Committee Investigating the Chicago Memorial Day Massacre, 1937.
Senator LA FOLLETTE. Were you successful in your efforts to get away from the
police?
Mrs. MARSHALL. No; I was not. After I evaded these policemen that were immediately
in front of me . . . . I was aware that my head was bleeding. I noticed that my blouse
was all stained with blood, and that sort of brought me to, and I started walking slowly
toward the direction from which a policeman had just clubbed an individual, and this
individual dragged himself a bit and tried to get up, when the policeman clubbed him
again. He did that four times.
Senator LA FOLLETTE. When he was on the ground?
Mrs. MARSHALL. While he was trying to get up. Every time he tried to get up the
policeman’s club came down on him. Then he took him by the foot and turned him
over. When the man finally fell so he could not move, the policeman took him by the
foot and turned him on his back, and started dragging him. As he turned over, I noticed
that the man’s shirt was all blood stained here on the side, so I screamed at the
policeman and said, “Don’t do that. Can’t you see he is terribly injured?” And at the
moment I said that, somebody struck me from the back again and knocked me down.
As I went down somebody kicked me on the side here, a policeman kicked me on the
side here.
Senator LA FOLLETTE. How can you be sure they were policemen?
Mrs. MARSHALL. Well, I could see from the sides. I could not identify the particular
policemen that did it, but I could see their uniforms, and I could see the edges, the
ends of the clubs from the side of my eyes.
Senator LA FOLLETTE. Go ahead.
Mrs. MARSHALL. So, after he kicked me I tried to get up, and they hit me three times
across the back, and then somebody picked me up and took me to the patrol wagon.
As we were walking along to the patrol wagon I noticed men lying all over the field.
Some of them were motionless. Some were groaning, but nearly all of those that were
lying down had their heads covered with blood, and their clothing was stained with
blood. They took me to one patrol wagon, and as I was walking toward it the policeman
is dragging me by the arm. As I was walking toward it, one man that I presumed was
a newspaper reporter asked my name...
Mrs. MARSHALL. ...and I said “Lupe Marshall”, and I gave him my address as quickly
as I could, and I was about to give him my telephone number when he twisted me
14
around and he said, “Come on, get going!” And as we approached the patrol wagon I
noticed that it was full, so they said, “No, we can’t get her in there.”
Then they took me to the other patrol wagon, and that patrol wagon was filled also, so
they took me to a distance and at that moment a patrol wagon drove in, or got into
position, but it was in motion, and it stopped right in front of us, and they opened the
door, and I was going to step in. I had one foot on the step when a policeman put his
hand on my back, on my buttocks, and shoved me in there, so that if I had not put my
hands across my face I would have struck the grating of the window in the front of the
patrol wagon in there. After I poised myself I walked over in the wagon and sat next to
the door, and observed out as much as I could. When the policemen started to pick
up those men that had been lying approximately where I had been standing when the
thing started, they started bringing them in by their feet and their hands, half dragging
them and half picking them up, and there was one man that they brought, the first one
that they put in the wagon, he was a heavy set fellow. He weighed about 200 pounds,
blonde fellow. They grabbed him, and shoved him in the wagon...and I noticed that he
had two red stains about the size of a penny, one on the upper side of his abdomen
and one lower, and immediately after that other policemen started bringing the other
wounded men, and that is the confusion in which they threw every one of the men that
were in the wagon with me. None of the men that were in the wagon with me were
able to sit up. None of them sat on the benches. I had to lift my feet up on to the bench
to allow them to put the men in there.
Senator LA FOLLETTE. Did they pile them one on top of another.
Mrs. MARSHALL. They piled them one on top of the other. There were some men who
had their heads underneath others. Some had their arms all twisted up, and their legs
twisted up, until they filled the wagon up, and one man said, “Well, I guess that’s all”,
and they shut the door.
Senator LA FOLLETTE. How many would you say were in the patrol wagon at this
time?
Mrs. MARSHALL. 16 men—16 men, besides myself.
Senator LA FOLLETTE. Were there any others seriously wounded in the wagon?
Mrs. MARSHALL. They were all seriously wounded. On the way to the hospital—
Senator LA FOLLETTE. Just a moment. Had any of them, could you see, received
any first aid?
Mrs. MARSHALL. No; none of them, because I saw where they were picking them up
from. They were picking them up from the original position in which they laid there.
They were bringing them into the wagon



# David Garland, _The Culture of Control: Crime and Social Order in Contemporary Society_ (2002)

"so how did the social changes of the late modernity come to impress themselves upon the field of crime control and criminal justice? Not directly to be sure, but through a series of accommodations and adjustments undertaken by various agencies in response to the specific pressures, problems or opportunities that these agencies encountered" - *103*


- Police departments across the USA responded to this crisis by seeking to professionalize themselves, by investing in the hardware and information systems... The outcome... was a motorized police force, withdrawn from close community involvement (to avoid charges of corruption), and intent on providing a 'rapid response' in answer to emergency call-outs from the public.*p. 114*,
	- **"This defines the ""Professional Model"" of the mid-century: a focus on technology, rapid response, and distance from the public. Marshall's testimony proves this model was either a failure or a false front, as police maintained political bias and brutality despite the supposed ""professionalization.**
- The police have been on the frontline of this losing battle... where increased crime complaints, allegations of widespread corruption, and a series of urban riots and political demonstrations combined to reduce the legitimacy of the police...*,p. 114* 
	- **This shows that even the pursuit of professionalism in the 1960s was an adaptive response to a crisis of legitimacy, indicating the ideal was already failing due to corruption (the same corruption Marshall witnessed in 1937, albeit focused on labor).**


- The state's claims have become more modest and more hesitant... there was clear sense of the failure of criminal justice agencies, a new focus upon their limitations, and a much more restricted sense of the state's power to regulate conduct and prevent crime*p. 108* 
	- **"This describes the predicament that caused the shift: The state publicly admitted its limits. To compensate for this weakness, politicians turned to highly visible, symbolic punitive acts (the ""acting out"" response) to prove they were still ""in control.**
- It is here that we see most clearly the myth of the sovereign state and its resilience in the face of all contrary evidence. For political actors... the essential and abiding attractiveness of the 'sovereign' response to crime (and above all of retaliatory laws that create stronger penal sanctions or police powers) is that it can be represented as an immediate, authoritative intervention. *p. 134* 
	- **"This is one of your most powerful quotes. It connects the political desire for visible sovereign power to the use of punitive force. The 1937 Massacre was a literal ""sovereign act"" of force against political opposition. Garland explains the political reason this kind of power is so attractive to the state.**
- ...the politician and the administrator... the scope and conditions for action in each case are quite different, as are their guiding rationalities, values, and interests. As we will see, these positional differences have shaped the different ways in which the predicament of crime control has been handled, and produced serious tensions *p. 112* 
	- **This justifies your focus on policing. The conflict between the pragmatic administrator (who seeks efficiency) and the politician (who seeks electoral advantage through populist punitiveness) is central to why police action often appears contradictory (professional standards vs. brutal execution).**



- This political reaction has become more pronounced as the conditions of political speech have changed over time... government and opposition parties competed to establish their credentials as being tough on crime, concerned for public safety, and capable of restoring morality, order and discipline... *p. 131* 
	- **"This describes the late 20th-century political culture that officially endorsed the punitive mindset. You can argue that Marshall's 1937 experience was an unauthorized punitive act by police against workers, but by the 1980s, the state was officially competing to be punitive against urban minorities—a shift in target, but not in underlying punitive intent.**
- In penal policy as in welfare policy, the imperative was the re-imposition of control, usually by punitive means. In both cases the population singled out as being most in need of control was composed of the welfare poor, urban blacks, and marginalized working-class youth.*,p. 132* 
	- **"This is the shift in the target of control. In 1937, the target was ""marginalized working-class"" labor organizers; by the 1980s, the target had expanded. The consistent theme is the use of punitive measures against marginalized groups perceived as a threat to social order."**




- High rates of crime have become a normal social fact... an integral part of social organization. *p. 147* 
	- **"Defines the Crime in 20th C N America context. You can argue that the brutal force Marshall experienced (1937) was an acute response, but by the late 20th century, the threat of crime itself became a chronic social fact that drove political support for the punitive model."**
- The myth that the sovereign state is capable of delivering 'law and order' and controlling crime within its territorial boundaries... [was] eroded... *p. 147* 
	- **"Directly relates to the theme of Policing and the failure of the professional model. When the state (including the police) couldn't deliver on its professional promise to control crime, it lost legitimacy. This forces it to revert to symbolic, punitive acts to reassert its sovereignty."**
- The pursuit of freedom—moral freedom, market freedom, individual freedom—brings with it the risk of insecurity and the temptation to respond with repression. *p. 157* 
	- **"Excellent theoretical link. The rise of neoliberal society (market freedom) caused social inequality and disorder, which then created new groups (the ""underclass"") as targets for punitive repression by the police."**



- The third feature of this strategy is that it purports to give a privileged place to victims... The naming of criminal laws and penal measures for crime victims (Megan’s law, Jenna’s law...) *p. 143* 
	- **"Shows the political mechanism for justifying punitive laws. You can contrast this late 20th-century political sanctification of the victim with the 1937 reality, where police actively injured and suppressed the victim (Lupe Marshall) to protect corporate power."**
- The symbolic figure of the victim has taken on a life of its own... His or her suffering is represented in the immediate and personalized idiom of the mass media, and speaks directly to the fears and angers of the viewing public... *p. 144* 
	- **"Essential for linking Crime in N. America to the media/public anxiety that supports punitive policing. The police's job shifts from impartial law enforcement to expressing public rage against the ""criminal other."**
- The police are on now a 'war footing' with respect to crime, and exercise direct control over sentencing levels, the system is set up to produce an instant response. *(Quoting Chapter 5, but highly relevant here)",p. 133* 
	- **(from Chapter 5),"This idea is reinforced by Chapter 6, which argues that the state's ""War on Crime"" rhetoric (p. 132) is directly tied to the political need to be seen acting tough. This is the punitive mode in action, prioritizing an ""instant response"" (arrests, stop-and-frisk) over professional, long-term community work."**



- The open, porous, mobile society of strangers that is late modernity has given rise to crime control practices that seek to make society less open and less mobile: to fix identities, immobilize individuals, quarantine whole sections of the population, erect boundaries, close off access. *p. 165* 
	- **"This is the ultimate goal of the punitive turn: social exclusion. You can argue that in 1937, the police sought to exclude workers from the mill and public space. By the late 20th century, this tactic was applied against the ""underclass"" using mass incarceration and aggressive street policing."**
- The undeserving poor are feared and resented... The pursuit of freedom—moral freedom, market freedom, individual freedom—brings with it the risk of insecurity and the temptation to respond with repression *p. 157 
	- **"Explicitly identifies the target. The fear of the ""undeserving poor"" and the ""underclass"" replaces the fear of the ""labor agitator"" from 1937, but the punitive institutional response remains focused on using the police to manage class and racial anxiety."**
