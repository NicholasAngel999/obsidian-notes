### “By looking at spiritualism in the Victorian age, one might find a signal moment in which belief mingled with the spectacular and entertainment became a central element of spiritual and religious experience.” - **pg. 8**

- Supernatural Entertainments argues that the rise of the spiritualist movement as a religious and cultural phenomenon was closely connected to the contemporary evolution of the media entertainment industry. - **pg.1**
- During the Victorian age, spiritualism was a very significant religious phenomenon in America and Britain, revolving around the belief that it was possible to exchange messages with the spirits of the dead - **pg. 2**
- My claim is that in order to comprehend spiritualism’s prominence, it is essential to understand its inclusion in a growing market for leisure activities and spectacular attractions. - **pg. 2**
- One might object that, despite the frequency of public demonstrations of spiritualism, spiritualist séances were most often conducted in private environments by closed circles of spiritualists. - **pg. 2**
- Séances were held in theaters and public halls, establishing a theatrical situation in which the medium played the role of the performer, and the sitters the role of the spectators - **pg. 2**
- Many spiritualist mediums were virtually indistinguishable from professional performers: they had managers and agents, advertised their performances in the press, and developed spirit phenomena characterized by a high degree of spectacularism and theatricality - **pg. 2**
- ..the development of trance phenomena contributed to establishing a situation that, despite being essentially theatrical, supported the claim of truthfulness in the mediums' performance - **pg. 37**
- The appealing of public controversies helps explain the popular success of public lectures on technological and scientific subjects. It is difficult to overestimate the relevance of this cultural form throughout the nineteenth century - **pg. 70**
- This attention to empirical evidence came together with the sense, shared by many believers, that spiritualism was a 'scientific' religion and that spirit communication could be experimentally verified - **pg. 4**
- ...a degree of uncertainty about the authenticity of an attraction would contribute to the arousal of interest in the public and the popular press - **pg. 3**
- The illusion was not produced in real time through mirrors or hidden projections, the ghostly illusions were conjured with the photographic medium. The effect, however, was no less spectacular. - **pg. 161**
- The appeal of such demonstrations was based on the delight of examining them for truth and humbug... - **pg. 79**
