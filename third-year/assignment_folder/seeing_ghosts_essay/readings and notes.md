# “By looking at spiritualism in the Victorian age, one might find a signal moment in which belief mingled with the spectacular and entertainment became a central element of spiritual and religious experience.” (Natale, 2016). Evaluate this argument in relation to Modern Spiritualism in the UK.

#### Overall argument is that we agree with Natale that spectacle drove growth however arguing deeper that psychological and religious function provided the necessary fuel

### “By looking at spiritualism in the Victorian age, one might find a signal moment in which belief mingled with the spectacular and entertainment became a central element of spiritual and religious experience.” - **pg. 8**

- Supernatural Entertainments argues that the rise of the spiritualist movement as a religious and cultural phenomenon was closely connected to the contemporary evolution of the media entertainment industry. - **pg.1**
- During the Victorian age, spiritualism was a very significant religious phenomenon in America and Britain, revolving around the belief that it was possible to exchange messages with the spirits of the dead - **pg. 2**
- My claim is that in order to comprehend spiritualism’s prominence, it is essential to understand its inclusion in a growing market for leisure activities and spectacular attractions. - **pg. 2**
- One might object that, despite the frequency of public demonstrations of spiritualism, spiritualist séances were most often conducted in private environments by closed circles of spiritualists. - **pg. 2**
- Séances were held in theaters and public halls, establishing a theatrical situation in which the medium played the role of the performer, and the sitters the role of the spectators - **pg. 2**
- Many spiritualist mediums were virtually indistinguishable from professional performers: they had managers and agents, advertised their performances in the press, and developed spirit phenomena characterized by a high degree of spectacularism and theatricality - **pg. 2**
- ..the development of trance phenomena contributed to establishing a situation that, despite being essentially theatrical, supported the claim of truthfulness in the mediums' performance - **pg. 37**
- The appealing of public controversies helps explain the popular success of public lectures on technological and scientific subjects. It is difficult to overestimate the relevance of this cultural form throughout the nineteenth century - **pg. 70**
- This attention to empirical evidence came together with the sense, shared by many believers, that spiritualism was a 'scientific' religion and that spirit communication could be experimentally verified - **pg. 4**
- ...a degree of uncertainty about the authenticity of an attraction would contribute to the arousal of interest in the public and the popular press - **pg. 3**
- The illusion was not produced in real time through mirrors or hidden projections, the ghostly illusions were conjured with the photographic medium. The effect, however, was no less spectacular. - **pg. 161**
- The appeal of such demonstrations was based on the delight of examining them for truth and humbug... - **pg. 79**

### Sides with the performative spectacle / entertainment 

- The intermingling of religion and entertainment can thus be seen as one of the defining characteristics of the spiritualist experience - **pg. 2**
- Séances were meant not only as moments of religious and scientific inquiry, but also as "a brilliant amusement where theatrical effects embellished an exciting shared experience." - **pg. 2**
- "nineteenth-century mediums can be regarded as a class of professional performers who, through the phenomenon of trance, shaped a complex dramatic space where theatrical performance mingled with claims of passivity and authenticity." - **pg. 2**
- Spiritualism "offered entertainment by encouraging believers and non-believers to test its truth." - **pg. 3**
- The state of trance "strengthened spiritualism’s claims of authenticity by recalling the principles of automatism, creative absorption, and rêverie." - **pg. 4-5**
- "The intermingling of performance and claims of authenticity, of spectacle and religious experience, is not a contradiction in spiritual séances: on the contrary, it represented the very core of the spiritualist experience." - **pg. 3**
- By employing an "aesthetics of absorption," mediums made the sitters oblivious to their role as viewers and spectators. - **pg. 15**



## Natale, Simone, ‘Spiritualism Exposed: Scepticism, Credulity and Spectatorship in End-of-the-Century America’, European Journal of American Culture, 29.2 (2010), pp. 131–44.

- "...I will argue that in both contexts the 'spirit medium' came to be understood as a performer, and the sitters as spectators." - **pg. 131**
- "The importance of maintaining a sceptical perspective was evoked again and again, by the opponents of the movement as well as by the spiritualists themselves." - **pg. 134**
- "The prosperity of this kind of shows was not only due to the appeal of deceptive practices but also due to the fact that against their sceptical spectators, the paying public, they were positing a credulous 'other': the spiritualist believer." - **pg. 136**
- "These are not conditions conducive to sharp sight and logical judgement, but they make the work of the medium easy. In this abnormal state of the subjects the sensorial is almost at the mercy of the preperceptive element." - **pg. 140**
- "The contrast between the credulity of these sitters and the readers of Triplett's writing... recalls the magician's complicity with its audience in performing an anti-spiritualist exposé." - **pg. 140**
- "The exposure of spiritualist trickery shaped a discourse on perception and sensorial delusion that anticipated in many ways later debates on cinematic spectatorship." - **pg. 131**

### chapter 4 

- "Being buried alive was, as Jan Bondeson (2001) has very capably shown, something of an obsession for Victorians." - *pg. 10*
	- **Where to Use:** As contextual evidence immediately following your assertion that high mortality rates fueled grief.
- "The victim... had torn his grave clothes and torn out one of his eyes and bitten off one of his fingers, while his face was literally in shreds." - *pg. 11*
	- Where to Use: Use this graphic detail (or reference its existence) to underscore the severity of the psychological terror that Spiritualism was capitalizing on, proving the emotional stakes were incredibly high.


### chapter 7 

- "One of these lost-and-found stories repeated in a formulaic fashion was that of the chimney-sweeper's boy coming down his mother's chimney." - *pg. 19*
	- Where to Use: After mentioning the Fox Sisters' early "rappings" and the theatrical nature of the domestic séance.


### chapter 22

- "A priest went with the Holy Sacrament to a young officer, saying that he had been asked to do so by an elderly lady who had called at his house. The officer said that it was nobody that had been sent by him... 'But that is the portrait of my mother, who has been dead for some time,' exclaimed the officer." - *pg.66*
	- Where to Use: After discussing the crisis of faith (Darwinism) and the search for tangible proof.

### chapter 66

- "The authority [agreed] that the death should be completely hushed up, and that the daughter should be made to believe... that her unfortunate mother never reached the hotel." - *pg.179*
	- Where to Use: As the lead evidence to link the Spiritualist exposure debate to the broader cultural fear of calculated, total delusion.
- "One collector believed it to be true 'because it is very much easier to believe that it happened than to suppose that it was invented'." - *pg.179*
	- Where to Use: As a powerful conclusion to your synthesis, demonstrating the complex emotional logic of Victorian credulity.



## Walsh, Brendan C, ‘“He Could Raise and Lay Ghosts at His Will”: Victorian Folklorists and the Creation of Early Modern Clerical Ghost-Laying’, Folklore (London), 134.3 (2023), pp. 281–303.

`Key Argument: The article states that the popular tradition of the "conjuring parson" (the ghost-laying clergyman) that Spiritualism's critics implicitly relied on was not a genuine early modern practice, but was invented or sensationalized by Victorian folklorists (like Hawker and Rees) themselves to boost the Anglican Church's authority in the face of Spiritualism.`

- "Clerical ghost-laying, however, is a spiritual tradition without a well-founded historical or theological precedent; predominantly derived from a small corpus of satirical and polemical depictions." - *pg. 281* 
	- Where to Use: In Body 2, after stating that Spiritualism promised an empirical religion to fill the vacuum of faith.
- "The elaborate ghost-laying ceremonies attributed to the early modern Protestant clergy are actually more aligned with the quasi-magical ceremonies performed by folk-healers and recusant Catholic priests." - *pg.282*
	- Where to Use: Use this as internal evidence within Body 2 to show the clergy's historical discomfort with magical practices.


- "Tales of early modern clergymen exorcising restless spirits actually originate from the pens of Victorian authors who developed the sensationalist folkloric exploits of conjuring parsons to fulfil their own literary or political agendas." - *pg. 282*
	- Where to Use: As the central claim of your Synthesis (Body 3), immediately before discussing the role of the press or figures like the Society for Psychical Research (SPR).
- "This work expresses a clear sense of continuity in this practice, with Rees remarking: 'Even in these days the clergy are not supposed to have lost this power over the spirit world...'" - *pg.284*
	- Where to Use: Use this to show the intent of the Victorian folklorists was to manufacture a direct link between the modern phenomenon and a false historical tradition.

### chapter 4
- "A cheap funeral with no flowers and a plain box for a coffin would have made it clear to the world that the corpse went unloved and unhonoured to the grave." *pg. 98*
- "For the working classes, however, pursuit of such customs could lead to financial ruin." *pg. 98*
- "The preoccupation with respectability and extravagance has encouraged a tendency for contemporary and historical commentaries on the funeral to focus exclusively on secular rituals of mourning as opposed to the burial service and the spiritual beliefs invested in the disposal of the dead." - *pg. 100*


### chapter 5 
- "The pauper funeral 'became the final stamp of failure'. In contrast, the private grave signified cultural membership..." - *pg. 131*
- "Antipathy to the pauper grave... was rooted largely in the body-snatching scandals which culminated in the passage of the Anatomy Act 1832." - *pg. 131*
- "The dishonour of pauper burial was inextricable from the anonymity of the grave, the inability to claim ownership of the dead and the denial of mourning rites." - *pg. 132*


### chapter 7 
- "It is impossible to disentangle financial anxiety from wider issues, such as sorrow for a lost relationship, crushed dreams, shattered homes and families, and broken routines and identities." - *pg.195*
- "Grief was manifest in diverse ways... Grief could be articulated through a multitude of signs: through physical symptoms (such as weight loss or nightmares); acts of commemoration; attempts to contact the dead..." - *pg. 195*
- "The desire to feel the presence of the dead required little proof of an afterlife when it allowed the bereaved to feel that death had not severed the relationship with the deceased, but, rather, repositioned it within a new context." - *pg. 221*


### chapter 8
- "Infant mortality... occurred with such frequency... that working-class parents were thought to have acquired a degree of immunity towards these deaths..." - *pg. 230*
- "Parents may have referred to child death in languages of pragmatism and resignation. Such expressions were easily mistaken for flippancy or hard-heartedness." - *pg.260*


## Noakes, Richard, Physics and Psychics : The Occult and the Sciences in Modern Britain (Cambridge University Press, 2019)

### chapter 1
- "...recent developments in the physical sciences suggested the strong possibility that an obscure force, fluid or agency somehow connected with life could be related to the known physical forces." - *pg. 21*
- "Spiritualists... believed that they exuded the scientific spirit of the age and were merely applying the empirical, inductive and rational methods of enquiry that had proved so successful in understanding the material cosmos..." - *pg. 47*
- "The 'mania'... had serious religious, moral and philosophical implications... spiritualists had abjured scriptural warnings about exchanges with potentially deceptive spirits... and chosen vulgar mediums rather than respectable clergymen as their spiritual guides." *pg. 49-50*


### chapter 2
- "The principal objective of the new society [the SPR] was to make an 'organised and systematic attempt to investigate that large group of debatable phenomena designated by such terms as mesmeric, psychical and Spiritualistic'..." *pg. 79-80*
- "Its vice-presidents and Council members included the Tory statesmen Arthur and Gerald Balfour... the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace, and the physicists Lodge, Stewart, the Third Baron Rayleigh and J. J. Thomson." - *pg. 81*


### chapter 4 
- "In the first of his QJS papers, Crookes presented a virtual manifesto for the proper scientific study of spiritualism in which both attributes played a prominent role." - *pg. 187*
- "The main purpose of Varley's electrical test was to establish the bodily relationship between Cook and 'Katie'... The test was effectively a remote sensing device that permitted investigators to gauge what Cook was doing without violating the crucial condition of not entering or illuminating the cabinet." - *pg. 206-207*
- "By seeing 'Katie' only seconds after touching and seeing what he believed to be Cook, Crookes was even more confident in the medium's honesty." - *pg. 209*



### Chapter 5
- "A key rhetorical strategy that many physical-psychical scientists adopted was to challenge the sharp distinction between physical and human instruments made by many psychological critics." - *pg. 261*
- "...he encouraged fellow psychical researchers to treat Palladino... not as a scientific person engaged in a demonstration, but as a delicate piece of apparatus wherewith they are making an investigation." - *pg. 263*
- "Lodge's decision was helped by... anxieties... he was clearly trying to protect Crookes's reputation in an organisation that appeared to be more equivocal about his work." - *pg. 272*
