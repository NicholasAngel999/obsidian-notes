### 1. The Context (Who, Where, When)

- **The Setting:** The investigation took place in **July 1894** on a small, private island (Ile Roubaud) off the coast of France, at the vacation home of **Professor Charles Richet** (a famous physiologist).
    
- **The Witnesses:** The team consisted of elite academics: **Oliver Lodge** (physicist), **F.W.H. Myers** (classicist/psychologist), **Charles Richet**, and later **Dr. Ochorowicz**.
    
- **The Subject:** Eusapia Palladino, an Italian medium. Lodge notes she was a guest in the house for weeks, allowing them to observe her in daily life, not just during séances.
    

### 2. The Setup & Controls (The "Science" Part)

Lodge spends pages 307–309 describing how they tried to prevent fraud. This is crucial for your argument about "male control."

- **Physical Restraint:** Eusapia sat at the head of a table. Lodge and Myers sat on either side of her. They held her hands tight. Her feet were placed on a cushion or under the sitters' feet. Sometimes her legs were tied with silk ribbons to the chair legs.
    
- **Lighting:** Unlike many séances which were pitch black, Lodge emphasizes that these sittings mostly happened in **"sufficient light"** (twilight or lamp light) to see her hands, which he argues makes the evidence more reliable.
    
- **Lodge's Confidence:** He states clearly: _"Any person... who might surmise that we were just deceived by the manual dexterity of a trickster... would be quite wrong"_.
    

### 3. The Phenomena Observed (The "Magic" Part)

Lodge lists the strange events they saw while holding her:

- **Levitation:** A heavy table (45 lbs) lifted entirely off the ground (sometimes 3–4 feet high) while Eusapia's knees and feet were being held down.
    
- **Musical Instruments:** An accordion tied up on the other side of the room began playing by itself. Lodge notes keys were depressed and notes were sounded distinct from any "mechanical" trick.
    
- **Physical Touches:** The scientists felt slaps, pinches, and handshakes from invisible hands. Lodge describes large, forceful hands grabbing him, even though he could see Eusapia’s real hands were held fast.
    
- **"Bulges" in the Curtains:** The heavy curtains behind Eusapia would bulge out as if someone were pushing them, resembling "a head" or "a large hand".
    

### 4. Descriptions of Eusapia (The "Class & Gender" Part)

This is the most important section for your social analysis. Lodge describes her personality in a way that reveals his own biases.

- **The "Vulgar" Peasant:** He describes her as _"illiterate"_ and a _"vulgar and tricky child"_. He implies she has low moral character but argues that her "tricky" nature is just a personality quirk, not proof that the ghosts are fake.
    
- **The "John King" Personality:** He explains that Eusapia loses consciousness and a male personality named **"John King"** takes over. Lodge seems to respect "John King" (who gives clear orders on how to run the experiment) more than he respects Eusapia herself.
    

### 5. Lodge’s Conclusion (The Verdict)

At the end of the report (p. 323–324), Lodge stakes his reputation on the phenomena being real.

- **Rejection of Fraud:** He admits Eusapia _would_ cheat if you let her, but claims that under his strict scientific controls, cheating was impossible.
    
- **The "Biological" Theory:** Instead of saying "it's spirits," Lodge tries to sound scientific. He hypothesizes that Eusapia might be able to biologically "project" her limbs or "vital force" across the room—a theory he calls a _"temporary prolongation of the body"_.

### Prejudice 
"She is a person of small education, to all appearance quite illiterate, and when in the trance state her behaviour is often that of a somewhat vulgar and tricky child... She was generally good-humoured... but she is liable to be plain-spoken and barely polite." *306*
- Scientists that investigated didnt trust her moral character 

"Her feet were on a cushion... and were also tied with a silk ribbon to the legs of the chair... Her hands were held by the sitter on either side, who also had a foot on one or both of her feet." *308*
- tying her up and holding her down seems like male domination not a scientific method 


"The intelligence controlling her... calls himself 'John King'... and speaks of the medium as 'my daughter'... and is quite distinct from her ordinary self." *309*
- Invented a male figure to gain some form of authority 


"It is, indeed, as if the [medium] were able to project a portion of her body... or else as if she had the power of creating a temporary prolongation of her body." *316*
- Physicist trying to be a biologist

- "The laboratory was the space of the male expert, the place where instruments and the senses could be isolated from external interference... The domestic séance was the antithesis of this." *125*

- "The problem for psychical researchers was how to secure the phenomena... under conditions that satisfied the rigorous standards of the physical sciences." *126*

- "Lodge was especially impressed by Palladino’s ability to wind up, play and swing a musical box suspended from the ceiling beyond her reach, and by what appeared to be a temporary vital 'prolongation' from her body (a manifestation of what Richet christened 'ectoplasm')." *228*


### Natale, Simone, ‘The Medium on the Stage: Trance and Performance in Nineteenth-Century Spiritualism’, _Early Popular Visual Culture_, 9 (2011), 239–55

- "I propose to regard the medium as a performer and the séance as a performance... The trance state, in this perspective, functioned as a frame that marked the performance, distinguishing it from everyday life." *241*

- "The trance state allowed the medium to perform actions and simulated phenomena that would have been considered improper in her normal waking state." *247*

- "The third and longest section, almost half of the text, discusses spiritualism as an effort to find scientific legitimacy for religious beliefs."
- "Chapters here cover mental sciences, evolution, and physics, detailing along the way the ambiguous relations between spiritualists and psychical researchers."

- "The 'plebeian ghost'... humbly contents itself with the Body of a white Horse... On other Occasions it wears the Carcass of a great black Dog, that glares full in your Face." *Page 36*
- "The 'ghost of dignity'... represented 'in every respect' the same person as he or she was in life, and inhabited their own house... The 'plebeian ghost', on the other hand, rarely appeared in its 'bodily likeness'." *Page 36*
- "The rustle of silk was a more frequently reported auditory sign of a ghostly presence, usually defining both the gender and social status of the ghost. Silk was not a fabric worn by the poor." *Page 28*
- "Ghosts... were mere delusions brought on by dreams, opium, drink, disordered spleens and weak minds." *Page 121*
- "The excessive timidity that possesses many people's mind... [means] they take every Shadow, which the Moon makes by her Shine on distant Objects, for a Ghost." *Page 134*
- "In January 1894 an inquest on the body of a 17-year-old servant named Elizabeth Bishop... concluded that she had died of excessive fright or syncope... shortly after she fell into a terrible fit and died." *Page 43*

- "This attitude may indeed help to explain why the telegraph often became spiritualized (and spirits became telegraphic) within the intertwining discourses of occultism and technological speculation." _23_
- "The medium was a passive instrument, well attuned to the subtle cues, sometimes described as vibrations, by which the spirits expressed themselves." _30_
- "In the absence of wires, women's impressionable nerves supplied the apparatus essential to here-to-hereafter communications." _30_



### De Ceglia, Francesco Paolo, and Lorenzo Leporiere, ‘Becoming Eusapia: The Rise of the “Diva of Scientists”’, _Science in Context_, 33 (2020), 441–71

- "When Eusapia Palladino arrived in the United States in late 1909, she was already a diva." _441_
- "Hence, even in the United States, Eusapia Palladino had to undergo the certification process that in Europe had made her the 'diva of scientists'." _442_
- "Nevertheless, it was not Del Gaiso who made Palladino into a diva, but another man named Ercole Chiaia.... Chiaia, like a true 'patron,' declared himself ready to make available the goods and connections necessary for Palladino to become the diva des savants." _442_



### Tromp, Marlene, _Altered States: Sex, Nation, Drugs, and Self-Transformation in Victorian Spiritualism_ (Albany: State University of New York Press, 2006)

- "Spiritualism was sexy.... The darkened parlor of the séance invited and embodied the disruption of the ordinary." _21_
- "In this world, the linked hands of the sitters violated customary barriers of age and gender, and the intimate spaces underneath the tipping tables set the stage for more than just spiritual stimulation. Faces and knees were caressed while the lights were out, gentlewomen submitted to be kissed by strangers, and the most private recesses of the past and present were exposed to the public eye." _21_
- "They flirtatiously engaged with the sitters, tendering kisses or the chance to squeeze their limbs or feel their hips as proof of their materiality." _22_



### Lachapelle, Sofie, _Investigating the Supernatural: From Spiritism and Occultism to Psychical Research and Metapsychics in France, 1853-1931_ (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2011).

- "While more religiously concerned thinkers had focused on the dangers that spiritism represented for the soul, physicians often diagnosed séances as pathological." _71_
- "Physicians, psychiatrists, and psychologists were poorly equipped to deal with the fleeting and elusive manifestations of the supernatural. Their conception of mediums and others who experienced the supernatural as subjects of research or patients limited their work." _98_





### Lamont, Peter, ‘Spiritualism and a Mid-Victorian Crisis of Evidence’, _The Historical Journal_, 47 (2004), 897–920

- "The overwhelming rejection of supernatural agency, and the nature of the response from orthodox science, suggests that such reported phenomena were less the result of a crisis of faith than the cause of a crisis of evidence." _897_
- "The widespread exposures of fraudulent mediums... affected subsequent views about the worth of such evidence. Nevertheless, the problems raised at the time by the most impressive accounts not only posed a serious challenge to accepted scientific knowledge, but also raised wider issues about authority and the nature of evidence." _920_




### Smajić, Srdjan, _Ghost-Seers, Detectives, and Spiritualists: Theories of Vision in Victorian Literature and Science_ (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010).

***"The psychical researcher, like the detective, is an expert reader of signs... tasked with distinguishing between genuine phenomena and fraudulent imitations."*** not sure if this is true 160


- "For if the events described... are not miracles, then they must be the result of a force or forces unknown to science... 'If we are to be scientific we must not only extend the boundaries of the known, but we must also be willing to admit the existence of the unknown.'" _179_
- "Hence the only escape which the physicist has... is to deny a causal nexus between physical and mental phenomena, and to deny that distinctly opens the way to supposing that there is something else than physical phenomena." _180_
