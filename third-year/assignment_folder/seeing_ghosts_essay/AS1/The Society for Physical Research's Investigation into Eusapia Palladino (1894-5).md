### 1. The Context (Who, Where, When)

- **The Setting:** The investigation took place in **July 1894** on a small, private island (Ile Roubaud) off the coast of France, at the vacation home of **Professor Charles Richet** (a famous physiologist).
    
- **The Witnesses:** The team consisted of elite academics: **Oliver Lodge** (physicist), **F.W.H. Myers** (classicist/psychologist), **Charles Richet**, and later **Dr. Ochorowicz**.
    
- **The Subject:** Eusapia Palladino, an Italian medium. Lodge notes she was a guest in the house for weeks, allowing them to observe her in daily life, not just during séances.
    

### 2. The Setup & Controls (The "Science" Part)

Lodge spends pages 307–309 describing how they tried to prevent fraud. This is crucial for your argument about "male control."

- **Physical Restraint:** Eusapia sat at the head of a table. Lodge and Myers sat on either side of her. They held her hands tight. Her feet were placed on a cushion or under the sitters' feet. Sometimes her legs were tied with silk ribbons to the chair legs.
    
- **Lighting:** Unlike many séances which were pitch black, Lodge emphasizes that these sittings mostly happened in **"sufficient light"** (twilight or lamp light) to see her hands, which he argues makes the evidence more reliable.
    
- **Lodge's Confidence:** He states clearly: _"Any person... who might surmise that we were just deceived by the manual dexterity of a trickster... would be quite wrong"_.
    

### 3. The Phenomena Observed (The "Magic" Part)

Lodge lists the strange events they saw while holding her:

- **Levitation:** A heavy table (45 lbs) lifted entirely off the ground (sometimes 3–4 feet high) while Eusapia's knees and feet were being held down.
    
- **Musical Instruments:** An accordion tied up on the other side of the room began playing by itself. Lodge notes keys were depressed and notes were sounded distinct from any "mechanical" trick.
    
- **Physical Touches:** The scientists felt slaps, pinches, and handshakes from invisible hands. Lodge describes large, forceful hands grabbing him, even though he could see Eusapia’s real hands were held fast.
    
- **"Bulges" in the Curtains:** The heavy curtains behind Eusapia would bulge out as if someone were pushing them, resembling "a head" or "a large hand".
    

### 4. Descriptions of Eusapia (The "Class & Gender" Part)

This is the most important section for your social analysis. Lodge describes her personality in a way that reveals his own biases.

- **The "Vulgar" Peasant:** He describes her as _"illiterate"_ and a _"vulgar and tricky child"_. He implies she has low moral character but argues that her "tricky" nature is just a personality quirk, not proof that the ghosts are fake.
    
- **The "John King" Personality:** He explains that Eusapia loses consciousness and a male personality named **"John King"** takes over. Lodge seems to respect "John King" (who gives clear orders on how to run the experiment) more than he respects Eusapia herself.
    

### 5. Lodge’s Conclusion (The Verdict)

At the end of the report (p. 323–324), Lodge stakes his reputation on the phenomena being real.

- **Rejection of Fraud:** He admits Eusapia _would_ cheat if you let her, but claims that under his strict scientific controls, cheating was impossible.
    
- **The "Biological" Theory:** Instead of saying "it's spirits," Lodge tries to sound scientific. He hypothesizes that Eusapia might be able to biologically "project" her limbs or "vital force" across the room—a theory he calls a _"temporary prolongation of the body"_.




# Lodge, Oliver J., ‘Experience of Unusual Physical Phenomena Occurring in the Presence of an Entranced Person (Eusapia Paladino)’, _Journal of the Society for Psychical Research_, 6 (1894), 306–60


"...I visited his island... in order to witness the physical phenomena asserted to occur in the presence of an **uneducated Neapolitan woman**, Eusapia Paladino..." _306_

"I have no doubt that she does this out of good nature and a wish to please ; **she is not a person of high education**, and apparently she does not clearly discriminate between what is really of interest and what is not." _322_

"...Eusapia herself in her ordinary state is not averse to exhibiting things which she seems to consider just as good as those which are accomplished while she is unconscious... **Such performances are doubtless extremely unwise on her part, but it would be unduly severe to call them fraudulent**... she succeeds only in giving a very poor imitation of some of them, such as could hardly deceive anyone." _322-333_

"It must be understood that **in her ordinary state Eusapia understands the phenomena as little as anybody**, and has less actual experience of them than other people have." _324_

- "The laboratory was the space of the male expert, the place where instruments and the senses could be isolated from external interference... The domestic séance was the antithesis of this." *125*

- "The problem for psychical researchers was how to secure the phenomena... under conditions that satisfied the rigorous standards of the physical sciences." *126*

- "Lodge was especially impressed by Palladino’s ability to wind up, play and swing a musical box suspended from the ceiling beyond her reach, and by what appeared to be a temporary vital 'prolongation' from her body (a manifestation of what Richet christened 'ectoplasm')." *228*


### Natale, Simone, ‘The Medium on the Stage: Trance and Performance in Nineteenth-Century Spiritualism’, _Early Popular Visual Culture_, 9 (2011), 239–55

- "I propose to regard the medium as a performer and the séance as a performance... The trance state, in this perspective, functioned as a frame that marked the performance, distinguishing it from everyday life." *241*

- "The trance state allowed the medium to perform actions and simulated phenomena that would have been considered improper in her normal waking state." *247*

- "The third and longest section, almost half of the text, discusses spiritualism as an effort to find scientific legitimacy for religious beliefs."
- "Chapters here cover mental sciences, evolution, and physics, detailing along the way the ambiguous relations between spiritualists and psychical researchers."

- "The 'ghost of dignity'... represented 'in every respect' the same person as he or she was in life, and inhabited their own house... The 'plebeian ghost', on the other hand, rarely appeared in its 'bodily likeness'." *Page 36*
- "The rustle of silk was a more frequently reported auditory sign of a ghostly presence, usually defining both the gender and social status of the ghost. Silk was not a fabric worn by the poor." *Page 28*
- "Ghosts... were mere delusions brought on by dreams, opium, drink, disordered spleens and weak minds." *Page 121*

- "This attitude may indeed help to explain why the telegraph often became spiritualized (and spirits became telegraphic) within the intertwining discourses of occultism and technological speculation." _23_
- "The medium was a passive instrument, well attuned to the subtle cues, sometimes described as vibrations, by which the spirits expressed themselves." _30_

- "When Eusapia Palladino arrived in the United States in late 1909, she was already a diva." _441_
- "Hence, even in the United States, Eusapia Palladino had to undergo the certification process that in Europe had made her the 'diva of scientists'." _442_
- "Nevertheless, it was not Del Gaiso who made Palladino into a diva, but another man named Ercole Chiaia.... Chiaia, like a true 'patron,' declared himself ready to make available the goods and connections necessary for Palladino to become the diva des savants." _442_



### Tromp, Marlene, _Altered States: Sex, Nation, Drugs, and Self-Transformation in Victorian Spiritualism_ (Albany: State University of New York Press, 2006)

- "Spiritualism was sexy.... The darkened parlor of the séance invited and embodied the disruption of the ordinary." _21_
- "In this world, the linked hands of the sitters violated customary barriers of age and gender, and the intimate spaces underneath the tipping tables set the stage for more than just spiritual stimulation. Faces and knees were caressed while the lights were out, gentlewomen submitted to be kissed by strangers, and the most private recesses of the past and present were exposed to the public eye." _21_
- "They flirtatiously engaged with the sitters, tendering kisses or the chance to squeeze their limbs or feel their hips as proof of their materiality." _22_

- "While more religiously concerned thinkers had focused on the dangers that spiritism represented for the soul, physicians often diagnosed séances as pathological." _71_
- "Physicians, psychiatrists, and psychologists were poorly equipped to deal with the fleeting and elusive manifestations of the supernatural. Their conception of mediums and others who experienced the supernatural as subjects of research or patients limited their work." _98_





### Lamont, Peter, ‘Spiritualism and a Mid-Victorian Crisis of Evidence’, _The Historical Journal_, 47 (2004), 897–920

- "The overwhelming rejection of supernatural agency, and the nature of the response from orthodox science, suggests that such reported phenomena were less the result of a crisis of faith than the cause of a crisis of evidence." _897_
- "The widespread exposures of fraudulent mediums... affected subsequent views about the worth of such evidence. Nevertheless, the problems raised at the time by the most impressive accounts not only posed a serious challenge to accepted scientific knowledge, but also raised wider issues about authority and the nature of evidence." _920_

- "For if the events described... are not miracles, then they must be the result of a force or forces unknown to science... 'If we are to be scientific we must not only extend the boundaries of the known, but we must also be willing to admit the existence of the unknown.'" _179_
- "Hence the only escape which the physicist has... is to deny a causal nexus between physical and mental phenomena, and to deny that distinctly opens the way to supposing that there is something else than physical phenomena." _180_

### **Section 1: Class and Performance (Completed)**

- **The Argument:** Lodge cannot accept that an uneducated, working-class woman has power over him. He tries to strip her of authority by focusing on her "low" social status, but she uses this to her advantage by "performing" the role of the peasant to lower his guard.
    
- **Primary Evidence (The "Proof"):**
    
    - Lodge calls her an "uneducated Neapolitan woman" and "not a person of high education".
        
    - He is embarrassed by her "plain-spoken and barely polite" nature.
        
    - **Context:** William Crookes (1874) demanding "weights" instead of "flowers".
        
- **Historiography (The Historians):**
    
    - **Owen Davies:** The "plebeian ghost" (working-class spirits are seen as vulgar/noisy).
        
    - **De Ceglia & Leporiere:** Palladino was a "diva" who constructed her own myth.
        
    - **Simone Natale:** The séance is a "theatrical performance," not a science experiment.
        

---

### **Section 2: Gender and the Body (Next Step)**

- **The Argument:** Lodge treats Palladino’s body not as a spiritual vessel, but as a dangerous biological object that must be restrained. The "scientific controls" (tying her up, holding hands) are actually a way for elite men to impose physical dominance over a powerful female body.
    
- **Primary Evidence (The "Proof"):**
    
    - Lodge’s detailed list of restraints: "her feet were on a cushion... and were also tied with a silk ribbon".
        
    - "Her hands were held by the sitter on either side".
        
    - He notes she is "subject to unaccountable ebbs and flows" (pathologising her).
        
- **Historiography (The Historians):**
    
    - **Marlene Tromp:** The "sexual" nature of the séance (touching in the dark) required scientists to use clinical language to hide the intimacy.
        
    - **Sofie Lachapelle:** The "medical gaze"—scientists treated mediums like hysterical patients to explain away their power.
        

---

### **Section 3: Science vs. Magic (The Epistemology)**

- **The Argument:** Lodge tries to translate "Magic" into "Data." He cannot accept the supernatural, so he invents pseudo-scientific words (like "prolongations") to turn the séance into biology. He is acting like a detective at a crime scene, trying to force order onto chaos.
    
- **Primary Evidence (The "Proof"):**
    
    - Lodge hypothesises that spirit limbs are a "temporary prolongation of the body" (biological explanation).
        
    - He tries to distinguish between "what is really of interest" (data) and "tricky" behaviour.
        
- **Historiography (The Historians):**
    
    - **Srdjan Smajić:** The scientist as "detective"—reading signs to catch a criminal/fraud.
        
    - **Richard Noakes:** The clash between the "male laboratory" (order) and the "female séance" (chaos).





### **SECTION 1: Class and Performance**

**The Argument:** Lodge dismisses Eusapia as an "ignorant peasant" to maintain his own authority, but she uses this "vulgar" persona to perform and lower his guard.

**Primary Source Evidence (Lodge & Crookes):**

- **Lodge (On her status):** He introduces her immediately as an **"uneducated Neapolitan woman"**.
    
- **Lodge (On her intellect):** He claims she is **"not a person of high education"** and lacks the ability to **"discriminate between what is really of interest and what is not"**.
    
- **Lodge (On her manners):** He describes her behavior as **"plain-spoken and barely polite"**.
    
- **Crookes (Supporting Context):** Crookes argues that while spiritualists talk of poetry, the scientist demands data: **"The spiritualist tells of flowers with the fresh dew on them... The scientific investigator naturally asks that an additional weight... be deposited on one pan of his balance"**.
    

**Secondary Source Evidence (Historians):**

- **Owen Davies:** Argues that working-class spirits were seen as the **"plebeian ghost"**—noisy and vulgar compared to polite society.
    
- **Simone Natale:** Argues that the séance was a **"theatrical performance"** where the trance was just a frame for the act.
    
- **De Ceglia & Leporiere:** Argue she became a **"diva of scientists"** by constructing her own myth.
    

---

### **SECTION 2: Gender and the Body**

**The Argument:** Lodge treats the medium’s body as a biological object that must be physically restrained (tied up) or pathologised (treated as sick/hysterical) to explain her power.

**Primary Source Evidence (Lodge & Crookes):**

- **Lodge (On physical restraint):** **"Her feet were on a cushion... and were also tied with a silk ribbon to the legs of the chair"**.
    
- **Lodge (On holding her):** **"Her hands were held by the sitter on either side"**.
    
- **Crookes (On pathology/biology):** Crookes describes the force not as a spirit, but as a biological fluctuation, noting the medium is **"subject to unaccountable ebbs and flows of the force"**.
    
- **Lodge (On her nature):** He dismisses her behavior as **"tricky"** or implying a child-like/hysterical state.
    

**Secondary Source Evidence (Historians):**

- **Marlene Tromp:** Argues that the **"scientific controls"** (holding hands/knees) allowed for illicit sexual intimacy in the dark.
    
- **Sofie Lachapelle:** Argues that scientists used a **"medical gaze"** to diagnose mediums as hysterical patients rather than spiritual leaders.
    

---

### **SECTION 3: Science vs. Magic (Epistemology)**

**The Argument:** Lodge tries to translate the "magic" of the séance into the "data" of the laboratory. He rejects the supernatural explanation and invents biological terms (like "prolongations") to make it sound scientific.

**Primary Source Evidence (Lodge & Crookes):**

- **Lodge (Scientific explanation):** He hypothesises that the spirit limbs are not ghosts, but a **"temporary prolongation of the body"** (ectoplasm/biology).
    
- **Crookes (On accuracy):** **"We must not mix up the exact and the inexact. The supremacy of accuracy must be absolute"**.
    
- **Crookes (Attacking "Fake" Science):** He complains about spiritualists who **"talk glibly of all sciences and arts... showing ignorance rather than understanding"**.
    

**Secondary Source Evidence (Historians):**

- **Srdjan Smajić:** Argues the scientist acts as a **"detective"** looking for clues and fraud.
    
- **Richard Noakes:** Argues there was a clash between the **"male laboratory"** (order) and the **"female séance"** (chaos).
