### 1. The Context (Who, Where, When)

- **The Setting:** The investigation took place in **July 1894** on a small, private island (Ile Roubaud) off the coast of France, at the vacation home of **Professor Charles Richet** (a famous physiologist).
    
- **The Witnesses:** The team consisted of elite academics: **Oliver Lodge** (physicist), **F.W.H. Myers** (classicist/psychologist), **Charles Richet**, and later **Dr. Ochorowicz**.
    
- **The Subject:** Eusapia Palladino, an Italian medium. Lodge notes she was a guest in the house for weeks, allowing them to observe her in daily life, not just during séances.
    

### 2. The Setup & Controls (The "Science" Part)

Lodge spends pages 307–309 describing how they tried to prevent fraud. This is crucial for your argument about "male control."

- **Physical Restraint:** Eusapia sat at the head of a table. Lodge and Myers sat on either side of her. They held her hands tight. Her feet were placed on a cushion or under the sitters' feet. Sometimes her legs were tied with silk ribbons to the chair legs.
    
- **Lighting:** Unlike many séances which were pitch black, Lodge emphasizes that these sittings mostly happened in **"sufficient light"** (twilight or lamp light) to see her hands, which he argues makes the evidence more reliable.
    
- **Lodge's Confidence:** He states clearly: _"Any person... who might surmise that we were just deceived by the manual dexterity of a trickster... would be quite wrong"_.
    

### 3. The Phenomena Observed (The "Magic" Part)

Lodge lists the strange events they saw while holding her:

- **Levitation:** A heavy table (45 lbs) lifted entirely off the ground (sometimes 3–4 feet high) while Eusapia's knees and feet were being held down.
    
- **Musical Instruments:** An accordion tied up on the other side of the room began playing by itself. Lodge notes keys were depressed and notes were sounded distinct from any "mechanical" trick.
    
- **Physical Touches:** The scientists felt slaps, pinches, and handshakes from invisible hands. Lodge describes large, forceful hands grabbing him, even though he could see Eusapia’s real hands were held fast.
    
- **"Bulges" in the Curtains:** The heavy curtains behind Eusapia would bulge out as if someone were pushing them, resembling "a head" or "a large hand".
    

### 4. Descriptions of Eusapia (The "Class & Gender" Part)

This is the most important section for your social analysis. Lodge describes her personality in a way that reveals his own biases.

- **The "Vulgar" Peasant:** He describes her as _"illiterate"_ and a _"vulgar and tricky child"_. He implies she has low moral character but argues that her "tricky" nature is just a personality quirk, not proof that the ghosts are fake.
    
- **The "John King" Personality:** He explains that Eusapia loses consciousness and a male personality named **"John King"** takes over. Lodge seems to respect "John King" (who gives clear orders on how to run the experiment) more than he respects Eusapia herself.
    

### 5. Lodge’s Conclusion (The Verdict)

At the end of the report (p. 323–324), Lodge stakes his reputation on the phenomena being real.

- **Rejection of Fraud:** He admits Eusapia _would_ cheat if you let her, but claims that under his strict scientific controls, cheating was impossible.
    
- **The "Biological" Theory:** Instead of saying "it's spirits," Lodge tries to sound scientific. He hypothesizes that Eusapia might be able to biologically "project" her limbs or "vital force" across the room—a theory he calls a _"temporary prolongation of the body"_.

### Prejudice 
"She is a person of small education, to all appearance quite illiterate, and when in the trance state her behaviour is often that of a somewhat vulgar and tricky child... She was generally good-humoured... but she is liable to be plain-spoken and barely polite." **Page:** 306
- Scientists that investigated didnt trust her moral character 

"Her feet were on a cushion... and were also tied with a silk ribbon to the legs of the chair... Her hands were held by the sitter on either side, who also had a foot on one or both of her feet." **Page:** 308
- tying her up and holding her down seems like male domination not a scientific method 


"The intelligence controlling her... calls himself 'John King'... and speaks of the medium as 'my daughter'... and is quite distinct from her ordinary self." **Page:** 309 
- Invented a male figure to gain some form of authority 


"It is, indeed, as if the [medium] were able to project a portion of her body... or else as if she had the power of creating a temporary prolongation of her body." **Page:** 316
