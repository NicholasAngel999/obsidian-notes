# SECTION 2: Gender, the Body, and Physical Control

_(~550–600 words total)_

## Paragraph 2.1 — The Female Body as a Site of Control

**Argument to make**  
Lodge frames Palladino’s body as inherently dangerous and unstable, requiring constant physical containment.

**Primary source quotes (Lodge)**

- “her feet were sometimes placed on an apparatus […] sometimes this apparatus was replaced by actual holding of the feet and legs”
    
- “her hands are held, and often her head is held too”
    
- “the whole forearm being frequently held as well as the hand”
    

**How to analyse**

- Stress _repetition_ and _detail_ → control is not incidental
    
- Restraint becomes evidence in itself
    

**Secondary sources to integrate**

- **Richard Noakes:**
    
    > “The laboratory was the space of the male expert… The domestic séance was the antithesis of this.”
    
- **James Turner:**
    
    > Psychical research sought “scientific legitimacy for religious beliefs.”
    

**Key analytical move**  
Argue that Lodge attempts to remake the séance room into a laboratory by disciplining the female body.

## Paragraph 2.2 — Intimacy, Sexual Anxiety, and Respectability

**Argument to make**  
Physical restraint functions to sanitise the séance’s illicit intimacy.

**Primary source (Lodge)**

- Language of “holding,” “apparatus,” “control”
    
- Absence of any acknowledgment of intimacy or discomfort
    

**Secondary source quotes**

- **Marlene Tromp:**
    
    > “The darkened parlor of the séance invited and embodied the disruption of the ordinary.”  
    > “Linked hands… violated customary barriers of age and gender.”  
    > Created conditions for “eroticized contact.”
    
- **Owen Davies:**
    
    > The “plebeian ghost” was noisy, vulgar, and physically disruptive.
    

**How to analyse**

- Elite men + working-class women + darkness = threat to respectability
    
- Scientific language disguises touching as discipline
    

**Key analytical move**  
Restraint reassures the reader that boundaries remain intact.

## Paragraph 2.3 — Medicalisation and Pathologising Female Power

**Argument to make**  
When physical restraint is insufficient, psychical researchers pathologise the medium.

**Primary source quotes**

- Lodge:
    
    > “Eusapia herself in her ordinary state… understands the phenomena as little as anybody.”  
    > Describes her as “tricky” and childlike.
    
- Lombroso (1909):
    
    > Medium’s power derived from female biological dysfunction.
    

**Secondary source quotes**

- **Sofie Lachapelle:**
    
    > Physicians were “poorly equipped to deal with the fleeting and elusive manifestations of the supernatural.”
    
- **J.N. Galvan:**
    
    > “The medium was a passive instrument.”  
    > Women’s “impressionable nerves supplied the apparatus.”
    

**How to analyse**

- Medical discourse removes agency
    
- Female body becomes unstable mechanism, not source of knowledge
    

---

## Section 2 Mini-Conclusion (2–3 sentences)

- Control operates physically and conceptually
    
- Gendered assumptions shape what counts as evidence
    
- Leads into epistemological failure

# SECTION 3: Science, Evidence, and Epistemological Failure

_(~550–600 words total)_

---

## Paragraph 3.1 — The Crisis of Evidence

**Argument to make**  
Lodge writes defensively because scientific authority is under strain.

**Primary source quote**

- Lodge:
    
    > “Any person… who might surmise that we were just deceived by the manual dexterity of a trickster… would be quite wrong.”
    

**Secondary source quotes**

- **Peter Lamont:**
    
    > Not a crisis of faith but a “crisis of evidence.”
    
- **James Turner:**
    
    > Psychical research sought scientific legitimacy.
    

**How to analyse**

- Reassurance replaces certainty
    
- Authority must be asserted repeatedly
    

---

## Paragraph 3.2 — Translating Magic into Biology

**Argument to make**  
Lodge invents biological explanations to avoid supernatural ones.

**Primary source quote**

- Lodge:
    
    > “Temporary prolongation of the body.”
    

**Secondary source quotes**

- **Richard Noakes:**
    
    > Difficulty of “securing the phenomena.”
    
- **Lachapelle:**
    
    > Medical frameworks limited investigators’ work.
    

**How to analyse**

- Neither spiritual nor scientific
    
- Pseudo-scientific compromise exposes limits of knowledge
    

---

## Paragraph 3.3 — The Scientist as Detective

**Argument to make**  
Lodge treats the medium as a suspect to be decoded.

**Primary source quotes**

- Lodge:
    
    > “discriminate between what is really of interest and what is not”
    
- Emphasis on “tricky” behaviour
    

**Secondary source quotes**

    
- **Davies:**
    
    > Ghost belief linked to “weak minds” and delusion.
    

**How to analyse**

- Suspicion structures observation
    
- Medium becomes object, not collaborator
    

---

## Paragraph 3.4 — Performance and the Failure of Mastery

**Argument to make**  
Lodge fails because he refuses to see the séance as performance.

**Secondary source quotes**

- **Simone Natale:**
    
    > “The séance was a performance… the trance state functioned as a frame.”
    
- **De Ceglia & Leporiere:**
    
    > Palladino as the “diva of scientists.”
    

**How to analyse**

- Performance undermines experimental logic
    
- Palladino actively shapes encounter
    

---

## Section 3 Mini-Conclusion (2–3 sentences)

- Scientific control does not equal explanation
    
- Lodge exposes fragility of authority
    
- The séance resists being reduced to data





By treating Palladino as a biological specimen to be "secured," Lodge ignored her active role in shaping the encounter. Francesco Paolo de Ceglia and Lorenzo Leporiere suggest that Palladino was far from a passive object of study; instead, she was the **“diva of scientists,”** a title that reflects her agency in managing the attention and expectations of the men investigating her. This performative element undermined Lodge's experimental logic; while he looked for mechanical "prolongations," Palladino was actively directing a cultural and psychological spectacle. Ultimately, Lodge’s inability to account for the medium's self-constructed myth meant that his "scientific" results were always subordinate to her performative mastery.


This performative element weakened Lodge’s experimental logic. While he searched for mechanical “prolongations,” Palladino was shaping a cultural and psychological spectacle. Because Lodge failed to recognise the myth she constructed around herself, his supposedly “scientific” findings remained secondary to her control of the performance.
