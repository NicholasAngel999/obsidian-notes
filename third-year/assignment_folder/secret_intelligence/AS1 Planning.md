John Cruso, Militarie Instructions for the Cavallrie (1644)  
Of Spies  
[…] There are also spies which are called double, which must be men of great fidelity. These (to get  
credit with the enemy) must sometimes give him true information of what passeth on the other side;  
but of such things, and at such times, as they do no hurt. But these kind of spies cannot continue long  
without being discovered.  
If it be possible, such spies must be had, as are entertained into domesticall service of the chief officers  
of the enemy, the better to know their intentions and designes.  
On the other side, there must be exceeding great care taken to beware of the enemies spies, which  
otherwise may do you as much mischief as you reap benefit by your own. To remedy this  
inconvenience,  
1. Those which shall be discovered must be punished with extreme rigour, which will be a  
means to deterre other which are or might be so imployed.  
2. Rogues, vagabonds, and idle persons must be chased out of the leaguer.  
3. No officer is to entertain any unknown person into his service. For oftentimes at table and  
otherwise things happen to be spoken, which were more fit to have been kept secret.  
4. No stranger is to be lodged within the quarters of any officer or souldier without speciall  
license. To this purpose a sudden command useth to be published, for every man to repair to  
his tent or cabin, whereby the Provost takes such as are remaining in the streets; which are  
made to give account of their businesse there.  
5. A means may be used to deceive the enemy by his own spies, giving it out that you intend  
one thing, and do a contrary: also by seeming no way mistrustful of the enemies drummes and  
trumpets (which are often sent with some pretended message, to heare and observe) and  
letting fall some words (which carry some probability) in their hearing, which they may take for  
truth.  
6. Sometimes it is wisdome, having discovered a spie, instead of punishing him, to tell him that  
(out of a good inclination to him) instead of severe punishment, you desire to do him good, &c.  
by such baits may become double spies. And if you suspect any of your own souldiers, it is best  
to dissemble it, and to make much of them, the better to discover them.  
Lastly, no drumme nor trumpet of the enemies is to be admitted into the leaguer, but first to be  
delayed by the Sentinells of the Cavallry, untill notice be given to the Lord Marshall, and he give leave  
for their admission: then they are to be committed to the provost Marshall, which suffereth no man  
to speak with them. The Lord Marshall having understood their message, acquainteth the Lord  
Generall therewith, that so a course may be taken for their dispatch. Other wayes and means may be  
used for discovering and preventing of spies, wherewith the ready invention of a quick-spirited  
Commander will abundantly furnish him upon every occasion […]

### Social class
"Rogues, vagabonds, and idle persons must be chased out of the leaguer."

"No stranger is to be lodged within the quarters of any officer or souldier without speciall license."

Crusso is not only talking of soldiers but also idle persons. Suggests the military camp (leaguer) was a crowded place filled with civilians. By ordering them to be "chased out," Cruso links social status to loyalty. To be poor and unemployed ("vagabond") is to be a security threat.


### Vulnerability of domestic sphere 
"spies must be had, as are entertained into domesticall service of the chief officers of the enemy, the better to know their intentions and designes."

"For oftentimes at table and otherwise things happen to be spoken, which were more fit to have been kept secret."

This shows the way even during war officers lived with relative luxury. Crusso identifies this domestic intimacy as a tactical weakness. the intentions of designes of generals are not stolen from locked safes, but overheard by servants pouring wine. 



### Weaponised kindness 
"instead of punishing him, to tell him that (out of a good inclination to him) instead of severe punishment, you desire to do him good..."

"...by such baits may become double spies."

The use of the word "baits" is crucial. It implies that kindness is a trap. Crusso views loyalty as a transaction - if you offer a spy safety you can purchase his allegiance. this is sophisticated psychological approach to turning agents. 


### Economy of truth 
"These (to get credit with the enemy) must sometimes give him true information of what passeth on the other side..."

"...but of such things, and at such times, as they do no hurt."
