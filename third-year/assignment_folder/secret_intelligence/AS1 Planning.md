John Cruso, Militarie Instructions for the Cavallrie (1644)  
Of Spies  
[…] There are also spies which are called double, which must be men of great fidelity. These (to get  
credit with the enemy) must sometimes give him true information of what passeth on the other side;  
but of such things, and at such times, as they do no hurt. But these kind of spies cannot continue long  
without being discovered.  
If it be possible, such spies must be had, as are entertained into domesticall service of the chief officers  
of the enemy, the better to know their intentions and designes.  
On the other side, there must be exceeding great care taken to beware of the enemies spies, which  
otherwise may do you as much mischief as you reap benefit by your own. To remedy this  
inconvenience,  
1. Those which shall be discovered must be punished with extreme rigour, which will be a  
means to deterre other which are or might be so imployed.  
2. Rogues, vagabonds, and idle persons must be chased out of the leaguer.  
3. No officer is to entertain any unknown person into his service. For oftentimes at table and  
otherwise things happen to be spoken, which were more fit to have been kept secret.  
4. No stranger is to be lodged within the quarters of any officer or souldier without speciall  
license. To this purpose a sudden command useth to be published, for every man to repair to  
his tent or cabin, whereby the Provost takes such as are remaining in the streets; which are  
made to give account of their businesse there.  
5. A means may be used to deceive the enemy by his own spies, giving it out that you intend  
one thing, and do a contrary: also by seeming no way mistrustful of the enemies drummes and  
trumpets (which are often sent with some pretended message, to heare and observe) and  
letting fall some words (which carry some probability) in their hearing, which they may take for  
truth.  
6. Sometimes it is wisdome, having discovered a spie, instead of punishing him, to tell him that  
(out of a good inclination to him) instead of severe punishment, you desire to do him good, &c.  
by such baits may become double spies. And if you suspect any of your own souldiers, it is best  
to dissemble it, and to make much of them, the better to discover them.  
Lastly, no drumme nor trumpet of the enemies is to be admitted into the leaguer, but first to be  
delayed by the Sentinells of the Cavallry, untill notice be given to the Lord Marshall, and he give leave  
for their admission: then they are to be committed to the provost Marshall, which suffereth no man  
to speak with them. The Lord Marshall having understood their message, acquainteth the Lord  
Generall therewith, that so a course may be taken for their dispatch. Other wayes and means may be  
used for discovering and preventing of spies, wherewith the ready invention of a quick-spirited  
Commander will abundantly furnish him upon every occasion […]

---
### Social class
"Rogues, vagabonds, and idle persons must be chased out of the leaguer."

"No stranger is to be lodged within the quarters of any officer or souldier without speciall license."

Crusso is not only talking of soldiers but also idle persons. Suggests the military camp (leaguer) was a crowded place filled with civilians. By ordering them to be "chased out," Cruso links social status to loyalty. To be poor and unemployed ("vagabond") is to be a security threat.


### Vulnerability of domestic sphere 
"spies must be had, as are entertained into domesticall service of the chief officers of the enemy, the better to know their intentions and designes."

"For oftentimes at table and otherwise things happen to be spoken, which were more fit to have been kept secret."

This shows the way even during war officers lived with relative luxury. Crusso identifies this domestic intimacy as a tactical weakness. the intentions of designes of generals are not stolen from locked safes, but overheard by servants pouring wine. 



### Weaponised kindness 
"instead of punishing him, to tell him that (out of a good inclination to him) instead of severe punishment, you desire to do him good..."

"...by such baits may become double spies."

The use of the word "baits" is crucial. It implies that kindness is a trap. Crusso views loyalty as a transaction - if you offer a spy safety you can purchase his allegiance. this is sophisticated psychological approach to turning agents. 


### Economy of truth 
"These (to get credit with the enemy) must sometimes give him true information of what passeth on the other side..."

"...but of such things, and at such times, as they do no hurt."

This defines the delicate balance of the "double spy." Total secrecy is impossible. To "get credit" (build trust), one must sacrifice some information. This shows that information was viewed as a currency to be traded



### Internal Paranoia and deception 
"And if you suspect any of your own souldiers, it is best to dissemble it, and to make much of them, the better to discover them."

The word "dissemble" (to conceal one's true motives) is key. A commander cannot be honest. He must "make much of" (be friendly to) the very men he suspects. This paints a picture of a military environment rife with paranoia, where a smile is used to mask suspicion until the traitor can be "discovered."




### Bureaucracy and the Police state 
"...no drumme nor trumpet of the enemies is to be admitted... but first to be delayed by the Sentinells... untill notice be given to the Lord Marshall..."

"To this purpose a sudden command useth to be published, for every man to repair to his tent or cabin, whereby the Provost takes such as are remaining in the streets..."

This demonstrates the professionalization of the army. There is a strict chain of command (Sentinel -> Lord Marshall -> Lord General). Furthermore, the use of "sudden command" (a surprise curfew) to catch people "remaining in the streets" shows that the army functioned like a police state, using the "Provost" to enforce internal control.




## ‘Knowledge and Confusion’, in War in England, 1642-1649 , by Barbara. Donagan (Oxford University Press, 2008), pp. 94–123
### Argues that the civil war was defined by intimacy and confusion because the enemy looked just like us military intelligence was not a professional science but a messy paranoid struggle to distinguish friend from foe in a world where soldiers and civilians were mixed together
#### Context paragraph - explain why Crusso was so paranoid, the enemy looked like his own men so strict rules necessary. 

- "The process revealed again the distinctive intimacy of this war in which language formed no barrier... and clothing [was] a shaky guide to affiliation." (p. 94)
- "Clothing was equally uncertain... rainbow coalitions did not necessarily help to distinguish enemies from friends when regiments on both sides wore green or blue or red." (p. 116)
- "Anecdotes suggest that the absence of visual distinction between enemies was commonplace... 'a party of the enemy's horse went amongst us as some of our own'." (p. 117)


#### Social class and Vagabonds - class analysis paragraph - Crusso wants to chase out "rogues and vagabonds" Donagan confirms that these poor mobile people were often the spies 

- "Transients 'of meanest rank, and quallity' were best fitted to act as these mobile messengers and observers: 'Peasants, Pedlers, Sellers of Strong-waters, or Tobacco, and the like'." (p. 102)
- "Civil society, with its poor transients, messengers, and travelling civilians coexisted alongside armies." (p. 94)
- "Civilians were unpredictable commodities, and armies had greater control over men who were formally enrolled and therefore subject to the rigours of military law." (p. 100)



#### Domestic servants and Women - Infiltrating households - Crusso suggests using "domesticall service" donagan explains why this worked 

- The civil war's women spies seem largely to have fallen into this humble category... [their] movements were so routine that they became invisible unless special vigilance called them to attention." (pp. 102, 105)
- "Many, it seems, were women, who often passed with some degree of freedom even through siege lines." (p. 105)


#### Paranoia and internal Suspicion - Crusso advises officers to suspect their own men, shows paranoia was widespread

- "Suspicions nurtured by the identity problems of civil war meant that soldiers and civilians were constantly alert for betrayal... while employers were quick to suspect their own agents of duplicity." (p. 104)
- "When siege lines were porous, when soldiers lived and fought among civilians... the mark of Cain was invisible and the kind of quarantine of information... was impossible." (pp. 103-104)




## ‘Chapter 16: An Axe and an Armada’, in _The Watchers : A Secret History of the Reign of Elizabeth I_ , by Stephen Alford (Penguin Books, 2013), pp. 243–57
### Alford is the opposite of Crusso, he argues a "golden age" of Elizabethan espionage where intelligence met high stakes game played by kings popes and master spies to save the state from foreign from invasion

- The Goal of Intelligence: In this era, spying wasn't about camp hygiene or vagabonds (like in Cruso); it was about State Security. It was about uncovering "The Enterprise of England"—the grand Catholic plan to invade and overthrow Elizabeth I.

- The Methods: Intelligence was centralized under "Great Men" like Sir Francis Walsingham. They used sophisticated methods: breaking codes, using double agents to infiltrate embassies, and managing international merchant networks.

- The Vulnerability: The system was fragile. Because it relied on specific geniuses like Walsingham, when he died in 1590, "his system of espionage" died with him. This contrasts with Cruso, who is trying to write a manual to make intelligence a standard military procedure that anyone can follow.


#### Intelligence as high politics vs camp security - Crusso worries about "rogues and vagabonds" in a field where Alford shows that Elizabethan intelligence was about global geopolitics 

- Relations between England and Spain were like a cold war: "...the nature of war, consisteth not in actual fighting; but in the known disposition thereto, during all the time there is no assurance to the contrary." **(p. 248)**
- "Elizabeth’s government... knew that there was no other plausible candidate [for the throne]... But Mary had always been more than a successor waiting in the wings... she was her cousin’s obvious rival heir." (p. 245)

#### Centralised system - Golden age of spying was highly centralised and professional unlike the ad-hoc methods Crusso describes
- Success required the ability "patiently to assess the information that came from all these sources: diplomats, merchants, intelligencers, military experts and the agents and double agents." **(p. 253)**
- Walsingham’s intelligencers "dabbled a little in forgery... the word entrapment was used by their enemies to describe the way Mary had been caught." (p. 243)
- Thomas Phelippes used "double agents to extract information... [and] to deceive and disinform the enemy." **(p. 252)**

##### This describes a high-level, bureaucratic machine run by experts (Walsingham, Phelippes) in London. Cruso’s manual is for soldiers in a muddy field who have to do it themselves.


#### The collapse of the system - crucial for conclusion - Crusso had to write his text in the first place because Elizabethan system fell apart 
- "Sir Francis Walsingham died in 1590, and along with him went his system of espionage, which was much too expensive to maintain in times of crippling government expenditure on war." **(p. 257)**
- Thomas Phelippes was left without a master... For the first time ever in his life Phelippes faced professional failure." (p. 257)


#### The limits of intelligence - even with the best spies you can still lose battles 
- "Intelligence perhaps shifted the balance of probability one way or another, but it could not in the end win a battle at sea or on land. It certainly could not pay the bills or alter the weather." **(p. 254)**

***Analysis: This aligns with Donagan’s point about "confusion." Both historians agree that while you can gather all the information you want, the chaos of war (weather, money, luck) often matters more.***



## Scott, Len, and Peter Jackson, ‘The Study of Intelligence in Theory and Practice’, _Intelligence and National Security_, 19.2 (2004), pp. 139–69

### The core argument - Intelligence is "under-theorized" most international relations scholars ignore it but it is essential to understanding how states survive. They identify 3 ways scholars study intelligence - digging through archives, creating models to explain failure and surprise and studying how intelligence is used domestically to control populations (Gestapo or KGB great examples) - Crusso manual fits firmly into the "state control" approach. Cruso isnt just looking for foreign enemies he is policing vagabonds and strangers within his own camp

#### State control - Argue that Cruso manual proves that early intelligence was just as much about policing the poor (vagabonds) as fighting the enemy
- "A third approach focuses instead on the political function of intelligence as a means of state control... [focusing on] the activities of security services... and their impact on political culture." (p. 143-144)
- "Many internal security agencies... possess powers of arrest and thus function as tools of state power." **(p. 154)**

***Use this to analyze Cruso’s section on the Provost and vagabonds. Cruso is using intelligence as a "tool of state power" to cleanse the camp of social undesirables.***


#### Morality of spying - Cruso suggests using "baits" and lies to trick spies. Scott and Jackson provide the ethical theory to back this up
- "'No ethics in the world can get round the fact that the achievement of 'good' ends is in many cases tied to the necessity of employing morally suspect or at least morally dangerous means.'" **(p. 156)**
- "To what ends should the 'morally suspect' means of intelligence be put? For whose 'good ends' should these means be employed?" (p. 156)

***Cruso advocates "morally suspect means" (lying, bribery, double-crossing) to achieve the "good end" of winning the war. You can argue that Cruso recognizes the dirty nature of the trade 350 years before modern theorists did.***


#### Defining Intelligence - Introduce what Cruso is doing
- Sherman Kent defines intelligence as three distinct things: "knowledge, the type of organisation that produces that knowledge and the activities pursued by that organisation." (p. 141)
- They quote Clausewitz to explain the difficulty of war: "Much of the knowledge or 'information' obtained in war is 'false' and 'by far the greatest part is of a doubtful character'." **(p. 146)**

***This connects perfectly to Cruso’s fear of "confusion." Cruso is trying to build an "organisation" (the Provost/Scouts) to filter out the "false" information Clausewitz warns about.***


#### Missing Dimension - Explain why texts like Cruso are rare and often overlooked 
- Intelligence has been described as "the missing dimension of international affairs." **(p. 140)**
- "Intelligence is the 'least understood and most "undertheorized" area of international relations'." (p. 141)

***You can conclude by saying that Cruso’s 1644 manual attempts to fill this "missing dimension" by writing down the rules of a secret world that was usually kept hidden.***


## Joby, Christopher Richard, _John Cruso of Norwich and Anglo-Dutch Literary Identity in the Seventeenth Century_ (D.S. Brewer, 2022)


### Chapter 6 

#### Before cruso there were almost no english books on cavalry only one of 94 military books published before the civil war devoted solely to cavalry 
#### cruso wasnt a veteran of foreign wars he was a captain of Norwich militia. He wrote the book to position himself as a _miles doctus_—a "learned soldier" who combined military skill with academic knowledge
#### The book relies heavily on the "military revolution" of the Eighty Years' War. Cruso explicitly states he is bringing the "practise of the Low-Countrey Warres" to England because the Netherlands was the "Academie of warre"
#### Although published in 1632, the book became the standard manual for the Civil War. The author notes that Parliamentary horse regiments likely followed Cruso’s instructions at the Battle of Edgehill (1642)

*Use these in your **Context Paragraph**. Argue that Cruso was trying to professionalize the English army by importing "modern" Dutch methods before the Civil War started.*

##### Military revolution and Dutch influence 
- Cruso’s subtitle claims the book is "rectified and supplied according to the present practise of the Low-Countrey Warres." (p. 145)
-  "The Low-countreys are (without all controversie) worthily stiled the Academie of warre, where the art militarie (if any where) truly flourisheth." (p. 145)
- Cruso was responsible for "introducing Dutch methods of drilling mounted troops at musters into England." (p. 146)


##### Structure of Intelligence
- "Part II, 'Of marching', advises officers how to keep their troops safe on the march... [giving] advice on guides, gaining intelligence, the use of scouts." (p. 155)
- "Part III... analyzes how the camp is to be secured... and how spies can gain information about the enemy." (p. 155)


##### The Audience - CLASS AND EDUCATION
- The book was intended for "the well-educated mounted officer... and so there were limited opportunities for potential officers to follow this advice" during peace time. (p. 155)
- Cruso’s intended readership was "not... the ordinary soldier, but rather the well-educated mounted officer." (p. 161)


##### Use in the Civil War
-  "Cruso’s instructions were 'largely followed' by the parliamentary horse regiments" at the Battle of Edgehill in 1642. (p. 163)
- "Oliver Cromwell... had not seen battlefield action until Spring 1643, and so... he and his fellow cavalry officers may well have needed to consult Cruso’s book." (p. 163)



### Chapter 9 - Argues that whilst the first English civil war was raging Cruso was not fighting on the front lines but was active as a military author and educator

#### Continues as captain of the "stranger militia" in Norwich ( a unit of Dutch/Walloon immigrants) but likely did not see active service. he focused on publishing manuals to help professionalise the amateur armies fighting in England 
#### Cruso walked a fine line. He dedicated books to both **Royalists** (like William Denny) and **Parliamentarians** (like Philip Skippon and Edmund Harvey). The author suggests he "put friendship above partisanship" or perhaps kept his options open to protect his immigrant community.
#### Chapter provides concrete proof that Militarie Instructions was used in the field. A pocket-sized handwritten transcript of the book exists, likely carried by a Royalist officer showing its practical use


##### 1664 edition - Explain why different to the 1632 original
- Cruso added an appendix to the 1644 edition because England had "now fallen into times of Action" (p. 256).
- He included a detailed list of soldiers' pay, ranging from "£10 a day for the 'Lord Generall' to as little as 8d. for a rank-and-file soldier" (p. 256).
- Cruso updated tactics, noting a shift from "horses wheeling away to charging through enemy ranks," showing he kept abreast of the latest battlefield developments (p. 257).


##### Practical use in the War
- A "handwritten transcript of Cruso’s book is preserved... in a miniature-size leather pocketbook, which probably belonged to a high-ranking Royalist officer" (p. 258).
- This proves that officers "deemed it sufficiently useful to transcribe it to take it onto the practice grounds or even on campaign" (p. 259).
- A copy in the British Library bears the bookplate of the Fairfax family (Parliamentarian commanders), suggesting men on both sides used it (p. 259).


##### Political Neutrality - Nuance context section - he wasnt a political radical he was a professional 
- "Cruso was willing to cross political boundaries, making public displays of his friendship with Royalists and Parliamentarians alike" (p. 261).
- The 1644 edition includes a poem by Colonel Edmund Harvey, a Parliamentarian who would later sit as a commissioner for the trial of King Charles I (p. 257).
- Yet, he also dedicated works to Royalists like William Denny. This suggests he may have done this "to keep his options open and avoid ending up on the wrong side" (p. 261).


##### Mars Scholar - Intelligence was becoming a learned profession 
- Edmund Harvey's poem praises Cruso: "Great Mars his scholar, is his fame: / Whose valour, honour, industrie, / Hath taught the use of Cavallry" (p. 258).
- Cruso presents himself as a _miles doctus_ (learned soldier), bridging the gap between "Mars (war) and the Muses (arts)" (p. 253).




## Carlton, Charles, _Going to the Wars : The Experience of the British Civil Wars, 1638-1651_, 1st ed. (Routledge, 1992)

### Chapter 4 
#### The core argument of this chapter is that the English Civil War armies were initially amateur mobs of civilians who had to be rapidly transformed into professional soldiers. Manuals like Cruso’s were the primary tool for this transformation, attempting to impose order, discipline, and "battle-proofing" on a chaotic situation.
#### Military manuals (like Cruso’s) were used to turn these civilians into soldiers. They taught the "naming of parts" (technical skills) but also aimed to instil discipline and courage.
#### While manuals tried to teach complex drills, the reality of battle often forced soldiers to "cut corners." However, the manuals were psychologically vital because "knowledge begets confidence."
#### Cruso is explicitly named as a key figure. His book was the "most important textbook" for cavalry because the gentry needed to learn how to be officers quickly.


##### Use to prove cruso wasnt just obscure theory it was standard of the text of war
- "The former’s [Cruso’s] _Militarie instructions for the cavallrie_ (first printed in Cambridge in 1632, and reissued in 1644) was the most important textbook on handling what turned out to be the civil wars' decisive arm". (103)
- "When it seemed likely that they would have to learn how to become officers responsible for leading men in a civil war, many gentlemen purchased training manuals". (102)
- "John Cruso, the author of the best-selling cavalry manual, also translated and published _The Complete Captain_... in the hope that knowing how to fight the Gallic wars might somehow help his readers win the civil ones". (103)


##### Scum of society - SOCIAL CLASS
- "Most counties press the Scum of all their Inhabitants... men taken out of prison, Tinkers, Peddlers and Vagrants that have no dwelling and such as whom no account can be given". **(p. 99)**
- - Norfolk's High Constable advised constables to "take idle servingmen, and such other able bodied persons who live dissolutely or idly". **(p. 99)**


##### Training as Battle-Proofing - explain psychological utility of Crusos strict rules
- "Writers of civil war training manuals agreed on one thing—that the primary purpose of training was not just to teach men military skills, but to steel them for the ordeal of war... its function was... 'battle-proofing'" . **(p. 115)**
- "By practice is gained knowledge, knowledge begets confidence and courage". **(p. 115)**



##### Difficulty of the Manuals - Too academic fro the field
- "Most manuals made military manoeuvres so complicated... that they could only be accomplished in the heat of battle by veterans with at least seven years of service". **(p. 104)**
- Regular soldiers "found it hard to address their social superiors" and would "cram" their prefaces with "classical illusions". **(p. 103)**



### Chapter 11
#### This chapter is the "Gold Dust" for your **"Social Class & Vagabonds"** paragraph. It proves that the Civil War was not just a military conflict, but a massive crime wave of theft and plunder. This explains exactly why Cruso was so paranoid about security.
#### Carlton argues that for most soldiers, the war was less about fighting for a cause and more about stealing property to survive (or for profit).
#### Armies operated like gangs. They demanded "free quarter" (food/lodging) and "taxes" from civilians. If civilians refused, they were beaten, robbed, or killed.
#### The chapter details how normal laws collapsed. Soldiers claimed "there was no other law now" but the gun.
#### This chaotic reality is exactly what Cruso was trying to fight. When he orders "rogues and vagabonds" to be chased out, he is trying to stop his own camp from turning into a den of thieves that would alienate the local population.


##### Soldiers as thieves - WHY CRUSO FEARED HIS OWN MEN
- "'The common sort of our countrymen that go to war, [go] of purpose more to spoil than to serve'". **(p. 339)**
- Soldiers "broke into the homes of loyal subjects on the spurious grounds that they were 'papists' houses'". **(p. 343)**
- "Soldiers could turn upon their masters... [they] roughed up his servants, drank up his beer, smashed up the crockery, took all his money". **(p. 359)**


##### The vagabonds and camp followers - USE TO BACK UP CRUSO ROGUES AND VAGABONDS RULE
- "Most counties press the Scum of all their Inhabitants... men taken out of prison, Tinkers, Peddlers and Vagrants". **(p. 99 - from Chapter 4, but relevant here too)**.
- Looting was so bad that "Lord General Essex swore to hang anyone found guilty". **(p. 341)**


##### The Protection Racket - INTELLIGENCE WAS ABOUT CONTROLLING THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE ARMY AND CIVILIANS 
- "At the local level fighting between garrisons all too frequently became little more than a gangland contest to control protection rackets" . **(p. 368)**
- Civilians paid soldiers "not to purloin when they spent the night in the parish church". **(p. 358)**


##### Winning hearts and minds _ CRUSO UNDERSTOOD THE STRATEGIC VALUE OF DISCIPLINE_
- Parliamentary commanders realized that by controlling plunder, "'we then gained their hearts'". **(p. 366)**
- "Such magnanimity brought an immediate military dividend. Civilians supported the invaders with food, lodging and, most precious of all, intelligence". **(p. 366)**
