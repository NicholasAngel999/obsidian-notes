John Cruso, Militarie Instructions for the Cavallrie (1644)  
Of Spies  
[…] There are also spies which are called double, which must be men of great fidelity. These (to get  
credit with the enemy) must sometimes give him true information of what passeth on the other side;  
but of such things, and at such times, as they do no hurt. But these kind of spies cannot continue long  
without being discovered.  
If it be possible, such spies must be had, as are entertained into domesticall service of the chief officers  
of the enemy, the better to know their intentions and designes.  
On the other side, there must be exceeding great care taken to beware of the enemies spies, which  
otherwise may do you as much mischief as you reap benefit by your own. To remedy this  
inconvenience,  
1. Those which shall be discovered must be punished with extreme rigour, which will be a  
means to deterre other which are or might be so imployed.  
2. Rogues, vagabonds, and idle persons must be chased out of the leaguer.  
3. No officer is to entertain any unknown person into his service. For oftentimes at table and  
otherwise things happen to be spoken, which were more fit to have been kept secret.  
4. No stranger is to be lodged within the quarters of any officer or souldier without speciall  
license. To this purpose a sudden command useth to be published, for every man to repair to  
his tent or cabin, whereby the Provost takes such as are remaining in the streets; which are  
made to give account of their businesse there.  
5. A means may be used to deceive the enemy by his own spies, giving it out that you intend  
one thing, and do a contrary: also by seeming no way mistrustful of the enemies drummes and  
trumpets (which are often sent with some pretended message, to heare and observe) and  
letting fall some words (which carry some probability) in their hearing, which they may take for  
truth.  
6. Sometimes it is wisdome, having discovered a spie, instead of punishing him, to tell him that  
(out of a good inclination to him) instead of severe punishment, you desire to do him good, &c.  
by such baits may become double spies. And if you suspect any of your own souldiers, it is best  
to dissemble it, and to make much of them, the better to discover them.  
Lastly, no drumme nor trumpet of the enemies is to be admitted into the leaguer, but first to be  
delayed by the Sentinells of the Cavallry, untill notice be given to the Lord Marshall, and he give leave  
for their admission: then they are to be committed to the provost Marshall, which suffereth no man  
to speak with them. The Lord Marshall having understood their message, acquainteth the Lord  
Generall therewith, that so a course may be taken for their dispatch. Other wayes and means may be  
used for discovering and preventing of spies, wherewith the ready invention of a quick-spirited  
Commander will abundantly furnish him upon every occasion […]

### Social class
"Rogues, vagabonds, and idle persons must be chased out of the leaguer."

"No stranger is to be lodged within the quarters of any officer or souldier without speciall license."

Crusso is not only talking of soldiers but also idle persons. Suggests the military camp (leaguer) was a crowded place filled with civilians. By ordering them to be "chased out," Cruso links social status to loyalty. To be poor and unemployed ("vagabond") is to be a security threat.


### Vulnerability of domestic sphere 
"spies must be had, as are entertained into domesticall service of the chief officers of the enemy, the better to know their intentions and designes."

"For oftentimes at table and otherwise things happen to be spoken, which were more fit to have been kept secret."

This shows the way even during war officers lived with relative luxury. Crusso identifies this domestic intimacy as a tactical weakness. the intentions of designes of generals are not stolen from locked safes, but overheard by servants pouring wine. 



### Weaponised kindness 
"instead of punishing him, to tell him that (out of a good inclination to him) instead of severe punishment, you desire to do him good..."

"...by such baits may become double spies."

The use of the word "baits" is crucial. It implies that kindness is a trap. Crusso views loyalty as a transaction - if you offer a spy safety you can purchase his allegiance. this is sophisticated psychological approach to turning agents. 


### Economy of truth 
"These (to get credit with the enemy) must sometimes give him true information of what passeth on the other side..."

"...but of such things, and at such times, as they do no hurt."

This defines the delicate balance of the "double spy." Total secrecy is impossible. To "get credit" (build trust), one must sacrifice some information. This shows that information was viewed as a currency to be traded



### Internal Paranoia and deception 
"And if you suspect any of your own souldiers, it is best to dissemble it, and to make much of them, the better to discover them."

The word "dissemble" (to conceal one's true motives) is key. A commander cannot be honest. He must "make much of" (be friendly to) the very men he suspects. This paints a picture of a military environment rife with paranoia, where a smile is used to mask suspicion until the traitor can be "discovered."




### Bureaucracy and the Police state 
"...no drumme nor trumpet of the enemies is to be admitted... but first to be delayed by the Sentinells... untill notice be given to the Lord Marshall..."

"To this purpose a sudden command useth to be published, for every man to repair to his tent or cabin, whereby the Provost takes such as are remaining in the streets..."

This demonstrates the professionalization of the army. There is a strict chain of command (Sentinel -> Lord Marshall -> Lord General). Furthermore, the use of "sudden command" (a surprise curfew) to catch people "remaining in the streets" shows that the army functioned like a police state, using the "Provost" to enforce internal control.




## ‘Knowledge and Confusion’, in War in England, 1642-1649 , by Barbara. Donagan (Oxford University Press, 2008), pp. 94–123
### Argues that the civil war was defined by intimacy and confusion because the enemy looked just like us military intelligence was not a professional science but a messy paranoid struggle to distinguish friend from foe in a world where soldiers and civilians were mixed together
#### Context paragraph - explain why Crusso was so paranoid, the enemy looked like his own men so strict rules necessary. 

- "The process revealed again the distinctive intimacy of this war in which language formed no barrier... and clothing [was] a shaky guide to affiliation." (p. 94)
- "Clothing was equally uncertain... rainbow coalitions did not necessarily help to distinguish enemies from friends when regiments on both sides wore green or blue or red." (p. 116)
- "Anecdotes suggest that the absence of visual distinction between enemies was commonplace... 'a party of the enemy's horse went amongst us as some of our own'." (p. 117)


#### Social class and Vagabonds - class analysis paragraph - Crusso wants to chase out "rogues and vagabonds" Donagan confirms that these poor mobile people were often the spies 

- "Transients 'of meanest rank, and quallity' were best fitted to act as these mobile messengers and observers: 'Peasants, Pedlers, Sellers of Strong-waters, or Tobacco, and the like'." (p. 102)
- "Civil society, with its poor transients, messengers, and travelling civilians coexisted alongside armies." (p. 94)
- "Civilians were unpredictable commodities, and armies had greater control over men who were formally enrolled and therefore subject to the rigours of military law." (p. 100)



#### Domestic servants and Women - Infiltrating households - Crusso suggests using "domesticall service" donagan explains why this worked 

- The civil war's women spies seem largely to have fallen into this humble category... [their] movements were so routine that they became invisible unless special vigilance called them to attention." (pp. 102, 105)
- "Many, it seems, were women, who often passed with some degree of freedom even through siege lines." (p. 105)


#### Paranoia and internal Suspicion - Crusso advises officers to suspect their own men, shows paranoia was widespread

- "Suspicions nurtured by the identity problems of civil war meant that soldiers and civilians were constantly alert for betrayal... while employers were quick to suspect their own agents of duplicity." (p. 104)
- "When siege lines were porous, when soldiers lived and fought among civilians... the mark of Cain was invisible and the kind of quarantine of information... was impossible." (pp. 103-104)




## ‘Chapter 16: An Axe and an Armada’, in _The Watchers : A Secret History of the Reign of Elizabeth I_ , by Stephen Alford (Penguin Books, 2013), pp. 243–57
### Alford is the opposite of Crusso, he argues a "golden age" of Elizabethan espionage where intelligence met high stakes game played by kings popes and master spies to save the state from foreign from invasion

- The Goal of Intelligence: In this era, spying wasn't about camp hygiene or vagabonds (like in Cruso); it was about State Security. It was about uncovering "The Enterprise of England"—the grand Catholic plan to invade and overthrow Elizabeth I.

- The Methods: Intelligence was centralized under "Great Men" like Sir Francis Walsingham. They used sophisticated methods: breaking codes, using double agents to infiltrate embassies, and managing international merchant networks.

- The Vulnerability: The system was fragile. Because it relied on specific geniuses like Walsingham, when he died in 1590, "his system of espionage" died with him. This contrasts with Cruso, who is trying to write a manual to make intelligence a standard military procedure that anyone can follow.


#### Intelligence as high politics vs camp security - Crusso worries about "rogues and vagabonds" in a field where Alford shows that Elizabethan intelligence was about global geopolitics 

- Relations between England and Spain were like a cold war: "...the nature of war, consisteth not in actual fighting; but in the known disposition thereto, during all the time there is no assurance to the contrary." **(p. 248)**
- "Elizabeth’s government... knew that there was no other plausible candidate [for the throne]... But Mary had always been more than a successor waiting in the wings... she was her cousin’s obvious rival heir." (p. 245)

#### Centralised system - Golden age of spying was highly centralised and professional unlike the ad-hoc methods Crusso describes
- Success required the ability "patiently to assess the information that came from all these sources: diplomats, merchants, intelligencers, military experts and the agents and double agents." **(p. 253)**
- Walsingham’s intelligencers "dabbled a little in forgery... the word entrapment was used by their enemies to describe the way Mary had been caught." (p. 243)
- Thomas Phelippes used "double agents to extract information... [and] to deceive and disinform the enemy." **(p. 252)**

##### This describes a high-level, bureaucratic machine run by experts (Walsingham, Phelippes) in London. Cruso’s manual is for soldiers in a muddy field who have to do it themselves.


#### The collapse of the system - crucial for conclusion - Crusso had to write his text in the first place because Elizabethan system fell apart 
- "Sir Francis Walsingham died in 1590, and along with him went his system of espionage, which was much too expensive to maintain in times of crippling government expenditure on war." **(p. 257)**
- Thomas Phelippes was left without a master... For the first time ever in his life Phelippes faced professional failure." (p. 257)


#### The limits of intelligence - even with the best spies you can still lose battles 
- "Intelligence perhaps shifted the balance of probability one way or another, but it could not in the end win a battle at sea or on land. It certainly could not pay the bills or alter the weather." **(p. 254)**

***Analysis: This aligns with Donagan’s point about "confusion." Both historians agree that while you can gather all the information you want, the chaos of war (weather, money, luck) often matters more.***
