## Hinsley, F.H, ‘Intelligence on German Appreciations & Preparations from February 1944 to D-Day’, in _British Intelligence in the Second World War : Its Influence on Strategy and Operations. Vol.3, Part 2_ , by F. H. Hinsley (HMSO, 1988), pp. 41–101

- "In addition to giving the Allies some assurance that, should any occur, untoward changes in German expectations and preparations would not go undetected, these Sigint developments enabled them to undertake a deception programme which had reasonable prospects of prolonging the enemy's uncertainty..." (p. 44-45).
- "That the Allies could rely on intelligence at least to this extent was due to the fact that PR, agents and reports from the Resistance—the non-Sigint sources whose contribution to knowledge of Germany's defences and order of battle continued to increase—were being supplemented more and more by Sigint." (**Page 44**)
	- show that COMINT acted as a **force multiplier**. It didn't replace **PR** (IMINT) or **Resistance** (HUMINT); it "supplemented" them, creating a more accurate order-of-battle than any single source could achieve alone.

- "Such a programme [deception] would have been impracticable if Sigint had not provided detailed information about Germany's measures and frequent confirmation that her own intelligence was in a poor state..." (p. 45)
	-  strongest argument for the "Senior Partner" status of COMINT. It suggests that while HUMINT told the lies, COMINT allowed the British to "listen in" and see if the Germans were actually falling for them.


- "That the Allies could rely on intelligence at least to this extent was due to the fact that PR, agents and reports from the Resistance—the non-Sigint sources whose contribution to knowledge of Germany's defences and order of battle continued to increase—were being supplemented more and more by Sigint." (p. 44)
- "It was on the strength of the previous study and the arrival of new evidence that the OIC [Operational Intelligence Centre] was able on 21 February to give the first warning that the German torpedo-boats had begun laying a major barrage in the Seine Bay..." (p. 91)
- "Still more important, a flood of PP signals specified the points through which the damaged ships and their rescuers were to manoeuvre. This enabled the OIC to establish, and to promulgate on 31 May, the exact limits of mine-free water in the Seine Bay and the vicinity of Le Havre." (p. 93)
- "The decrypts which enabled the deception authorities to monitor changes of emphasis in Germany's expectations, and to adjust the deception programme accordingly, were part of the steady increase in Sigint relating to western Europe..." (p. 49-50)
- "...the Japanese diplomatic decrypts [COMINT]... indicated that neither the Allied deception programme nor the enemy's shortage of good intelligence had prevented the Germans from appreciating that the Allies would probably deliver not merely diversionary landings but even their initial main assault in Normandy..." (p. 61)



## Howard, Michael, ‘The United Kingdom, September 1939-August 1942’, in _British Intelligence in the Second World War: Vol.5: Strategic Deception (History of the Second World War)_ (London: H.M.S.O., 1990), pp. 3–30

- "Situations are bound to arise in which, although it is not possible to prevent the enemy from acquiring some information, it is possible to ensure that the intelligence he does so acquire is misleading or false." (p. 3)
- "Intelligence and counter-intelligence operations always tend, like any other, to develop a momentum of their own. A major task both of intelligence and of security authorities is to hamper the intelligence-gathering of unfriendly powers." (p. 3)
- "...the German General Staff will not move a single division on an agent's report alone, it must be supported by other evidence, e.g. aerial reconnaissance [IMINT], W/T, R/T, Embassy reports, etc." (p. 12)
- "The radio traffic of these agents [HUMINT] would help British cryptanalysts to break enemy cyphers. The questionnaires provided by their German controllers would show what information was already available to German intelligence and for what operations the enemy was preparing." (p. 9)
- "It [MI5] knew from ISOS intercepts that Garbo's story was true and that his reports were being relayed as accurate by his Abwehr controls." (p. 20)
- "Thanks to ISOS decrypts we have been able to watch the Germans making arrangements for the [agents] despatch, discussing arrangements arising from payments sent to them or letters received from them, and passing on from one Stelle to another their reports and comments on them." (p. 20-21)
- "By 1942 all the cyphers of the Abwehr, both hand and machine, had been broken, and most of their traffic was being currently read." (p. 15)
- "In the spring of 1942 MI5 could assert, with a high degree of certainty, that they controlled 80 per cent of the German espionage network in the United Kingdom." (p. 15)




## Ferris, John, ‘Intelligence’, in _The Cambridge History of the Second World War. Volume I, Fighting the War_ , ed. by John Robert Ferris and Evan Mawdsley (Cambridge University Press, 2015), pp. 637–63 

- "Intelligence is the collection, collation and analysis of evidence to enable an effective and efficient use of scarce resources. Intelligence is not a form of power, but rather a means to guide its use." (p. 637)
- "The best intelligence is useless without efficient links between the organs which collect, evaluate and act upon it. Flaws are possible anywhere along the chain. When one link breaks, so will the whole." (p. 638)
- "In intelligence, the Western Allies multiplied each other's strengths. German and other Axis agencies divided them. They competed not only against the enemy, but against each other." (p. 646)
- "German intelligence failed precisely when Nazi strategy most needed it to succeed. Given the material odds, however, Germany might have lost even had it possessed an ULTRA, and the Allies had not." (p. 649)
- "From the fount of signals intelligence flows the richest streams of data, but usually these yield first-rate material on second-rate issues, while those on the greatest of matters are hard to tap." (p. 638)
- "The Germans failed to attack high-grade American or British cryptographic machines because the task was hard, resources scarce, and only massive and centralized cryptanalysis could break them. This, the divided German system could not provide. One German cryptanalyst called a unified system 'a monster organization'. Britons named it Bletchley Park." (p. 647)
- "The Allies never read every important enemy message, or most of them. ULTRA was not the best source on everything; nor were technical achievements in cryptanalysis and battlefield success linked in a simple way." (p. 649)





## Reynolds, David, ‘The Ultra Secret and Churchill’s War Memoirs’, _Intelligence and National Security_, 20.2 (2005), pp. 209–24


- "Ultra stayed secret; indeed, as Sir Alexander Cadogan of the Foreign Office observed to Professor David Dilks, intelligence remained 'the missing dimension' of most diplomatic and military histories." (p. 209)
- "As a meeting of senior civil servants privately acknowledged in 1969, the omission of intelligence made all the existing official war histories 'misleading', but it was essential bulwark for the Ultra secret. Historian Richard Aldrich has called this 'the last deception operation of the Second World War'." (p. 212)
- "From Churchill's telegram to Eden on 30 March Pownall removed the reference numbers of the intercepts; a commendation of 'searching and vigilant British intelligence' became a tribute to 'our agents on the spot'. This became a familiar ploy: disguising sigint as humint." (p. 217-218)
- "But the reader is given the impression that the information came from 'active and daring' agents in Athens where 'German staffs preserved less than their usual secrecy'." (p. 219)
- "Second, and more interesting, was the fear that if the Germans and Japanese became aware of the part played by special intelligence, they might claim they had not been fairly defeated an echo of the 'stab in the back' myth about 1918, which Hitler had exploited so successfully." (p. 212)



## ‘Chapter 7: Signals Intelligence and the Battle of the Atlantic’, in _Decoding History : The Battle of the Atlantic and Ultra_ , by W. J. R. Gardner (Macmillan, 1999), pp. 120–45 & notes : 237-241

-  "But perhaps the most important thing to remember is that Ultra by whatever name it was known was only a part of Comint, in itself a subset of Sigint and even that was a component of the whole range of intelligence available to the Allies." (**Page 121**)
- "In discussing Ultra and the part that it played in the Battle of the Atlantic, it is important to understand not only what it was and how it was obtained but also to realise how it fitted into a number of contexts... Unless these are absorbed to some extent, then the tendency to mythologise Ultra becomes nearly irresistible..." (**Page 120**)
- "The foremost among these [other techniques] is almost certainly direction-finding of transmissions from ships and submarines at sea." (**Page 126**)
- "It is difficult to say exactly how good HF DF was as a locating device, as it could vary very considerably with circumstances. A broad American study taking in two years' worth of data concluded that average accuracy was in excess of 100 miles..." (**Page 128**)
- "Direction-finding was thus extremely valuable inasmuch as at its best it provided reasonable positional information and some trend of the movement of a submarine or a group of U-boats." (**Page 128**)
- "In the first few months of the war, the considerable geographical limitations of the British system - with its stations confined to the British Isles was largely offset by the fact that many German operations were in any case restricted to the North Sea." (**Page 126**)
- "It should never be forgotten that the mere act of intercepting an enemy signal provides information in itself, however rudimentary." (**Page 125**)
- "In broad terms it [Traffic Analysis] is the study of an enemy's communications as a system and the conclusions which may be drawn from such an investigation." (**Page 130**)
- "In practical terms, however, it contributed greatly to assessments of U-boat numbers at sea, submarine casualties and realising that the enemy was experiencing problems of ambiguous orders or reports." (**Page 131**)
- "However, it would not be going too far to say that TA and Ultra enjoyed a symbiotic relationship." (**Page 131**)
- "However, for the group operations - the Rudeltaktik - which predominated in several periods... plentiful radio communication was not just desirable but essential to the conduct of operations." (**Page 124**)
- "This [centralized command] was to be one of the submarine force's most vulnerable points." (**Page 125**)
- "The Enigma machine was widely employed by the Germans, not just for submarines, not just by the Navy and it was widely used in the communications systems of organisations beyond the armed forces... Thus the SS, the Abwehr, the police [used it]." (**Page 134**)

## ‘Chapter 2: Before the Landings’, in _Ultra in the West : The Normandy Campaign 1944-1945_ , by Ralph Francis. Bennett (Faber, 2009), pp. 40–67 and notes 267-270

- "Thus 352 Division, a field division of good quality which moved into the Côtentin in March and right up to Omaha beach a few days before the landings, received only a single mention in Ultra before the fighting began... The reason why Ultra could not be relied on to know anything about troops with satisfactory land communications has already been sufficiently explained..." - (p.55)
- "It could do neither of these things, so long as the enemy relied – as he could until the middle of June – on telephones and teleprinters in preference to the slower business of encoding and decoding wireless messages." (p.48)
- "Ultra gave regular information about the German assessment of Allied dispositions all through the vital months, and this was presumably of considerable value both to the deception planners (as confirmation that their deceit was a success)..." (p.52)



## Smith, Chris, ‘Bletchley Park and Big Science: Industrialising the Secret War, 1939–1945’, _Journal of Intelligence History_, 20.2 (2021), 163–82[](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://doi.org/10.1080/16161262.2020.1835698)

- "...by 1944 Bletchley Park had developed from its pre-war common room culture structure, into 'an industrialized enterprise: finely arranged division of labor, very high staff numbers, an emphasis on through-put, and innovative mechanization at bottlenecks.'" (p.110)
- "Thus, Big Science was characterised by five major components, known as the five 'M's: Money, and lots of it; Manpower, in huge numbers; Machines, of vast scale; a Military or national security purpose; and tight Media control and management." (p.112)
- "Senior agency managers concluded that machine work, particularly the operation of communications equipment, was so uninteresting that it was 'necessary to intervene and institute factory methods.'" (p.119)
