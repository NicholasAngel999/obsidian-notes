# Hinsley, F.H, ‘Intelligence on German Appreciations & Preparations from February 1944 to D-Day’, in _British Intelligence in the Second World War : Its Influence on Strategy and Operations. Vol.3, Part 2_ , by F. H. Hinsley (HMSO, 1988), pp. 41–101

- "In addition to giving the Allies some assurance that, should any occur, untoward changes in German expectations and preparations would not go undetected, these Sigint developments enabled them to undertake a deception programme which had reasonable prospects of prolonging the enemy's uncertainty..." (p. 44-45).
- "That the Allies could rely on intelligence at least to this extent was due to the fact that PR, agents and reports from the Resistance... were being supplemented more and more by Sigint." (p. 44).
	- show that COMINT acted as a **force multiplier**. It didn't replace **PR** (IMINT) or **Resistance** (HUMINT); it "supplemented" them, creating a more accurate order-of-battle than any single source could achieve alone.

- "Such a programme [deception] would have been impracticable if Sigint had not provided detailed information about Germany's measures and frequent confirmation that her own intelligence was in a poor state..." (p. 45)
	-  strongest argument for the "Senior Partner" status of COMINT. It suggests that while HUMINT told the lies, COMINT allowed the British to "listen in" and see if the Germans were actually falling for them.


- "That the Allies could rely on intelligence at least to this extent was due to the fact that PR, agents and reports from the Resistance—the non-Sigint sources whose contribution to knowledge of Germany's defences and order of battle continued to increase—were being supplemented more and more by Sigint." (p. 44)
- "It was on the strength of the previous study and the arrival of new evidence that the OIC [Operational Intelligence Centre] was able on 21 February to give the first warning that the German torpedo-boats had begun laying a major barrage in the Seine Bay..." (p. 52)
- "Still more important, a flood of PP signals specified the points through which the damaged ships and their rescuers were to manoeuvre. This enabled the OIC to establish, and to promulgate on 31 May, the exact limits of mine-free water in the Seine Bay and the vicinity of Le Havre." (p. 54)
- "The decrypts which enabled the deception authorities to monitor changes of emphasis in Germany's expectations, and to adjust the deception programme accordingly, were part of the steady increase in Sigint relating to western Europe..." (p. 49-50)
- "...the Japanese diplomatic decrypts [COMINT]... indicated that neither the Allied deception programme nor the enemy's shortage of good intelligence had prevented the Germans from appreciating that the Allies would probably deliver not merely diversionary landings but even their initial main assault in Normandy..." (p. 61)

- "Situations are bound to arise in which, although it is not possible to prevent the enemy from acquiring some information, it is possible to ensure that the intelligence he does so acquire is misleading or false." (p. 3)
- "Intelligence and counter-intelligence operations always tend, like any other, to develop a momentum of their own. A major task both of intelligence and of security authorities is to hamper the intelligence-gathering of unfriendly powers." (p. 3)
- "...the German General Staff will not move a single division on an agent's report alone, it must be supported by other evidence, e.g. aerial reconnaissance [IMINT], W/T, R/T, Embassy reports, etc." (p. 12)
- "The radio traffic of these agents [HUMINT] would help British cryptanalysts to break enemy cyphers. The questionnaires provided by their German controllers would show what information was already available to German intelligence and for what operations the enemy was preparing." (p. 9)
- "It [MI5] knew from ISOS intercepts that Garbo's story was true and that his reports were being relayed as accurate by his Abwehr controls." (p. 19)
- "Thanks to ISOS decrypts we have been able to watch the Germans making arrangements for the [agents] despatch, discussing arrangements arising from payments sent to them or letters received from them, and passing on from one Stelle to another their reports and comments on them." (p. 20-21)
- "By 1942 all the cyphers of the Abwehr, both hand and machine, had been broken, and most of their traffic was being currently read." (p. 15)
- "In the spring of 1942 MI5 could assert, with a high degree of certainty, that they controlled 80 per cent of the German espionage network in the United Kingdom." (p. 15)
