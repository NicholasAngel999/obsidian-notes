Priestly, Joseph, Original Letters by the Rev. John Wesley, and His Friends: Illustrative of his Early History, with other curious papers, (Birmingham: Thomas Pearson, 1791) 

 

Letter 1-Mrs Wesley to Samuel Wesely (12 Jan) 

 The Wesely family was afraid that their son, Sam, was dead, due to a poltergeist that knocked on the doors and made a groaning sound. At first they thought it was an omen for the father and refused to tell him, but later on they did (p119-120) 
One night they heard a lot of noise like footsteps running about the house. Both Mr and Mrs Wesley went to check on the children, and Mrs Wesley reported that she felt as if money had been dropped on her front (pp120-121) 
On the next night they had Mr Hoole stay the night, and heard three knocks and then a stop before three knocks for several hours, as well as what sounded like carpentry work. Mr Wesley eventually asked the poltergeist to knock again if it was ‘Sammy’, but no more knocks came (p121) 
 

Letter 2- Samuel Wesely to Mr Wesely (30 Jan) 

Sam Wesely asks his father for more information, not believing the story, as well as from Mr Hoole (p122) 
Letter 3-Samuel Wesely to Mrs Wesely (19 Jan) 

He tells his mother that ‘those who are wise’ shouldn't believe in superstitions things such as that she told him of (p123) 
He asks if the noise happened in the same place and at the same time, if the whole family heard it, if it couldn't be animals, and if everyone was accounted for when the noises happened (p123) 
 

Letter 4- Mrs Wesely to Samuel Wesely (25 or 27 Jan) 

She says that she originally thought it was rats or weasels, as had previously inested the house, and perchased a horn to be brought to scare them away as had been done previously. However, it only made the sounds louder both day and night, making her believe it to be supernatural (p125) 
The servants were new but were unlikely culprits as they were the most afraid. The maid refused to be on her own after dark and was effectively catatonic after the disappearance, and the other, a Mr Brown, was also afraid and was asleep in the neighbouring room when the footsteps sounded and didn't even wake up (p126) 
She says the children were all asleep, but one, Hettey, was shivering a lot and did so whoever it was near (p-126-127) 
Letter 5- Susanna Wesely to Samuel Wesely (24 Jan) 

She says the maid fist heard it in the dinning room as a groan, and that it lasted a whole 'lunar month’ as a series of different noises (p128) 
The first night she and her sisters heard it it was several knocks from above them and from the garden whilst at dinner, but no one was at these rooms. Then, after they stayed up late, they heard loud thumps from beneath them and the thumbeling of a latch. It then knocked all around the nursery before knocking so hard on the cribs/beds it made them rock before Mr Hoole and Wesely  came in (pp128-129) 
She mentions a sound like a man in a night gown in the nunnery (p129) 
Since then it had been quite, except during prayer when Mr Wesely prayed for the King and Prince (p130) 
 

Letter 6-Samuel Wesely to Susanna Wesely (9 Feb) 

He asks for more news rather than waiting for his father. He then goes on to say that it makes sence the Devil, or ‘old Nick’ would be an enemy of King George (p131) 
 

Letter 7- Samuel Wesely to Mrs Wesely (12 Feb) 

He asks more about the situation and then adds as a p.s asking if she had dug where she felt money being pored at her (p132) 
 
Letter 8- Samuel Wesely to Mr Wesely (12 Feb) 

Complains he hasn't heard from him (pp132-133) 
 

Letter 9- Samuel Wesely to Emily Wesely (16 Feb) 

He asks for what is happening, and if the ‘spirit' did anything to Hetty, who he says was 'particularly troubled’ (p133) 
 

Letter 10- Mr Wesely to Samuel Wesely (11 Feb) 

Says that as of the 11th February all is quiet (p134) 
says he hasn't heard written it all down but will wait for his son to come home as he doesn't want to sell it and attract fame (p134) 
 

 
Letter 11-Emily Wesely to Samuel Wesely (Received same time as letter 10 with no date) 

She says the whole situation has left her believing in spirits and that she could not uncover any trick from the whole month (p135) 
She says that just after 10 after she had locked up (1 week after the first disturbance) and was going up the stairs she heard a sound like a bag of coal being dumped into the kitchen and a gust coming from there. She then went to her bed and heard the bottles under the stairs be smashed like a stone hit them. Hattey, who was on the stairs, then said that she saw the figure of a man in a night gown which made her run to the nursery. (P136) 
After they told their farther he smiled and saw them off to bed the following nights, imagining it to be his daughters playing pranks and her mothers thought it was rats,  
She said it could be made angry after the horn was blown, and wouldn't leave them alone after 10. A sound like ironworks would single it's coming before three knocks and then the beds in the nursery being knocked on, a sound none of them could imitate (p137) 
It would answer to their mother if she stamped her foot, and knock when Emily Wesely was putting the children to sleep. It also responded with knocks when ‘little Kesy’ stamped her foot on the floor (P137) 
It follows Hettey when she moves (p138) 
Emily believed it to be witchcraft. She said the year prior there was undoubtedly witches in the nearby town, and that for a few weeks Mr Wesely preached against seeing cunning-folk, and the skirt was particularly angry with him. A creature that looked like a headless badger was also seen twice, once under a sisters bed [Hetty’s?], and then in the dining room. A white rabbit was also seen in the kitchen before mysteriously disappearing which had to be witchcraft. (P138) 
 

Letter 12-Susanna Wesely to Samuel Wesely (27 March) 

The previous Sunday Mr Wesley's truncheon stood up on its own and span before 'some wretch’ picked it up and it then stayed still (p139) 
They had by this time named it ’Jeffery’ and were quite board of it (p139) 
 

Passage of a letter from Mrs Wesely to Samuel Wesely (27 March) 

 She is confused why he is so interested in their ’guest’ (p140)  
 

 

Passage of a Letter from Emily Wesely to Mr N. Berry (1 April) 

The ‘spirit’ reappeared and was heard by everyone in the house. The maid saw it open and close a cabinet door whilst she was drinking before doing its usual knocking, Elemiy refused to write more based on her fear that it would hear her (p140)
