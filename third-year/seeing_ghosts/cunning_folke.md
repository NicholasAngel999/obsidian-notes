Magic has been effectively outlawed since Angelo-Saxon and Viking times (p1) 
Exodus 22:18 states “Thou Shalt not suffer a witch to live” (p1) 
Cases of sorcery were infrequent in England and rarely involved people who can be confidently identified as witches, and this only becomes more prevalent towards the mid 14th century, but this can be explained through survivorship bias (pp1-2)  
Cunning-folk's actions were mostly see as moral offences to be delt with by the Church, unless they had also committed a crime against the state in the doings of their magic (p2) 
There was a major fear that cunning-folk may do detective work that would see someone falsely imprisoned/arrested for crimes they didn’t commit, or effect someone socially in a negative way. For instance, in 1390 in London John Berkyng was put in the pillory and banished from London after having accused John Geyte of crimes against Robert Mysdene, for which Geyte was nearly killed. Another example was John Holond from Suffolk, who was arrested for burglary after being identified by ‘negremaunsers’. His jailors took little pity regarding his plight as he professed his innocents, such was the importance of the words of a cunning person (pp3-4) 
The state never ran a campaign of suppression of cunning folk until the rule of Henry VIII, where cunning folk over witches were targeted the hardest, in the first Witchcraft Act of 1542, which punished cunning-folk on pain of death for their actions, although this was repealed by Edward VI in 1547(pp4-5) 
Despite the repeal of national laws against cunning folk, the Church redoubled its efforts, and in 1549 Archbishop Cranmer’s Articles of Visitation made it the responsibility of the Church to report magic users. The Catholic Bishop of London, Edmund Bonner reiterated this point during Mary I’s rule, and during Elizabeth I’s rule The Royal Articles demanded the same things from the Church (pp5-6) 
It was only in 1563 (after failed attempts in 1559) [reign of Elizabeth I] that a law was passed again against cunning folk, called the Bill ‘Against Conjurations, Enchantments, and Witchcrafts’, with cunning folk and occultists and the main targets. However, it didn’t have the death penalty for the first offence, with the convicted facing a years imprisonment and four stints in the pillory. Two convictions was a life imprisonment, with the death penalty reserved for murder by witchcraft of the conjuring of evil spirts. However, this law was actually mostly applied to witches rather than its intended targets (pp6-7) (later, stealing using human corpses would also be punishable by death [p8]) 
A 1604 Act under King James I saw ‘divination for treasure, the detection of lost or stolen property and provoking unlawful love’ as capital punishment after the 2nd offence and would remain in force for 131 years (pp8-9) 
Between 1649-1653 (the Rump Parliament) and attempt was made to further the 1604 Act, but this did’t get far, but shows that this was still an issue for the elite and that there was some dissatisfaction at the 1604 act nearly 50 years later (p9) 
Fewer than 100 cases of magic (excluding witchcraft) were heard at assize courts (serious crime courts) between 1563-1736 (p9) 
Most cunning folk were tried at the lesser courts of quater session, and most of these cases were concerned with detecting thieves and lost things. That this was held at lower courts indicated that officials saw the problem of cunning-folk as secondary to that of witches, backed up by when such crimes were rarely heard by assize courts, who seldomly placed the full weight of the law on cunning folk (p11) 
Cunning folk were more likely to be indited as witches than other people due to the understanding that they held magical powers. And it was no surprise that most of these people were women rather than men who had been reported as witches due to neighbourly disputes (pp12-13) 
The were witch hunts but not cunning folk hunts because English law worked by people bringing cases to the courts, so witch hunts were actions from below, by people who feared witches but saw cunning folk as useful (p13) 
Most cunning folk were tried by the Church rather than by the courts, as the Church could be proactive and followed a theoloigical poiunt of view against cunning folk, which was preferable since the Church courts had less power than the secular courts, and most cunning folk only received admonishment (p14) 
The Reformation did little to alter the Church view of cunning folk in England, but Protistans did empathise the ‘diabolical’ nature of cunning folk (p15) 
The 17th century did, however, witness the ununiform decline in Church prosecution of cunning-folk and popular magic. In London there are few prominent cases after 1600, whereas in places like Yorkshire and Essex there were cases for the first few decades of the century (p17) 
The reasoning for the lack of church court attacks on cunning folk is likely due to both that cunning folk were always a lower priority and that more mundane and moral problems were taken up at an increasing level by the Church as populations started to increase at a faster pace (pp18-19) 
By the late 17th century there was also a marked decrease in England based witch trails. The last on in England was in 1712, and Exeter saw its last case in 1684/85 (p19) 
The decline of witchcraft trails came when justices and judges became more cautious about evidence given about magical crimes and more sceptical that such abilities were true. This carried over to cunning folk despite there being more physical evidence that they [at least believed] were practising magic (pp19-20) 
The Witchcraft Act of 1736 removed all previous acts and stipulations and replaced them with laws for ‘punishing such Persons as pretend to exercise or use any kind of witchcraft, sorcery, inchantment, or conjuration’. The punishment was a maximum years imprisonment and quarterly appearances in the pillory at market days. Although there were only few cunning folk killed for witchcraft, this removed that possibility. Cunning folk were the main targets, but they were no longer seen as doing the devil’s work and they were seen as committing fraud as it was now viewed that their acts weren’t feasible (pp20-21) 
Up to the 19th century the rates of arrest and trail for cunning folk remained similar to what it had been for the past 200 years (p21) 
Thomas Howell, ‘who was in a good position to know things’ stated that the 1736 Act mostly tried people for ‘extorting money, under the pretence of telling fortunes, recovering lost or stolen goods, etc...’ (p23) 
The 1824 Vagrancy Act’s Section IV targeted people ‘pretending...to tell fortunes’ with 3 months hard labour, and repeat offenders up to a years imprisonment and wiping for men and became the main way for the law to target cunning-folk  (pp23-24) 
Interestingly, toward the end of the 19th century cunning folk were bringing criminal cases against their clients, mostly for assault. In Devon, for instance, William Henry Hillman prosecuted a farmer's son who scratched him with a wooden dart. He has come to Hillman to have a bewitchment removed from his family, but had become convinced that Hillman had rebewitched them (pp24-25)
