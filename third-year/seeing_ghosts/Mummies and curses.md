In 1827 the three volume novel The Mummy!: A Tale of the Twenty-Second Century was published by Jane Webb, in which the Paharo Cheops (Khufu) is reanimated in a pyramid tomb (103) 

The Mummy Cheops wasn’t a horror character, but more comedic as a man out of time giving out ‘sage political advice’ (p104) 

Edgar Allan Poe’s ‘Some Words with a Mummy’ (1845) is also comedic. It is reanimated with an electrical current and when it wakes up it falls over and proceeds to angerly recount the ways in which Egypt was better than the USA (p104) 

Such tales of reanimated mummies are likely to have originated from the mummy unwrapping's of Thomas Pettigrew (p104) 

Albert Smith’s Mr Grubbe's Night with Memnon is an example of Mummy mania. Published n 1843, Mr Grubbe becomes fascinated with Ancient Egypt after a mummy unwrapping, and goes to the British Museum, where he finds himself locked in. He falls asleep and wakes to the Ancient Egyptian artefacts having come alive, including the Mummies which dance and drink punch. He eventually becomes besotted with a woman (p104) 

Victorians falling in love with mummies had first been seen in the 1940 short story Le Pied de momie or The Mummy’s Foot, in which the main character falls in love with a mummy whose foot is all the remains but whose whole is shown to him in a vision, but is rebuffed by her due to the immense age difference (p104) 

By the mid-century the stories of mummies did take on a horror approach, mostly by women writers. After writing Little Women, Louisa May Alcott published Lost in a Pyramid (1869), which preceded After Three Thousand Years, by Jane Godwin Austin in 1868 (p105) 

In H. Rider Haggard’s 1889 novel Cleopatra, Cleopatra steals the gems of Menkau-ra from his chest cavity, and trigger a curse put on them that prevents anyone taking the gems for selfish ends. Cleopatra's servant is later found dead after the spirit of Menkau-ra kills him, and Cleopatra’s death is reimagined as the curse of the mummy (p106) 

Arthur Connan Doyle also wrote two mummy stories, one being The Ring of Thoth (1890), whereby an immortal mummy seeks his death to be reunited with his love, and Lot No. 249, later republished in French as La Momie vivante, or The Living Mummy after the discovery of Tutankhamun (p106) 

A more familiar mummy can be seen in Bram Stoker’s The Jewl of the Seven Stars, whereby Queen Tera leaves blood and destruction in her wake, and when her body is unwrapped it is found that she is the doppelgänger of the Egyptologist who brought her body from Egypt to the UK (p106)






LUCKHURST, R. (2010), The mummy's curse: a study in rumour. Critical Quarterly, 52: 6-22 

When Lord Carnarvon died in April 1923 it was quickly reported to be a curse placed on Tutankhamun's tomb by popular novelist Marie Cornelli (who was reported to have a ‘rare book...not in the British Museum’) and Arthur Connan Doyle, who was touring America to promote spiritualism at the time. Author Rider Haggard, considered an amateur authority, suggested reburning Tutankhamun to prevent ill on tourists (pp6-7) 

Arthur Weigall, novelist and Daily Express correspondent, gave fuel to the idea of a curse in his essay The Malevolence of Ancient Egyptian Spirits, whereby he gave examples of ‘creepy stories’ from his own experiences (p7) 

Rumour was the central way that ‘spooky stories’ of Egyptian objects spread, and these rumours fed of their own refutation to give them authority (p8) 

It was said that there were to curses in the tomb. One in the anti-chamber on a clay tablet reading ‘Death shall come on swift wings to whoever toucheth to tomb of the Pharaoh’, and the other on the entrance that read ‘Death to those who entre’ (p8) 

29 deaths were prescribed to King Tut’s tomb within the next few years, including the American robber-baron George Jay Gould (soon after visiting the tomb), Carnarvon’s half-brother the MP Aubrey Herbert (who died in 1923), Governor-General of Angelo-Egyptian Sudan Sir Lee Stack (assassinated in 1924), and several men associated with the project (p8)  

When Weigall died in 1934, a newspaper story was given the headline ‘Arthur Weigall, who denied Tutankhamen's Cruse, is Dead’, followed by a new headline ‘A Curse Killed Aurthur Weigall’ (p9) 

Another example was Thomas Douglas Murry, who donated to the British museum  ‘The Unlucky Mummy’ , which Bertram Fletcher Robinson wrote about for a new story in 1904 and died later in 1907 rather suddenly from a fever at the age of 35. Archibald Marshall would later recall that he had just been telling him about a mummy to whom all who had examined it had died that Murry had said he had himself examined before his death (p9) 

The case of Douglas Murry was said to have taken place some time in 1964, when he purchased a casket of a priest of Amen-Ra. Either Murry or Aurthur Wheeler took the mummy home, but Murry supposedly lost an arm in a shooting accident in Egypt, lost the two porters carrying the case home, and lost two members of his party. When Wheeler gave the case to his sister, Mrs Warwick Hunt in 1869, her family also suffered, and an attempt to photograph the case in 1887 saw the death of both the porter and the photographer before being given to the British Museum in 1889 where it was known to have ‘nervous effects’ (pp10-11) 

The case of Douglas Murry would come up again in 1912 after W.T Stead, longtime editor of the Pall Mall Gazette and famous spiritualist, died on the Titanic, supposedly having talked about the case which was then assumed by reporters to have been on the Titanic itself and therefore the reason for the sinking (p11)




📚 Nineteenth-Century Mummy Fiction (Dobson, 2022)
The summary traces the evolution of mummy narratives in Victorian literature, from early comedy to later horror and romance.

Early Comedic Mummies (Pre-Mid-Century):

Jane Webb's The Mummy!: A Tale of the Twenty-Second Century (1827): Reanimated Pharaoh Cheops (Khufu) is not a horror figure, but a comedic "man out of time" who dispenses "sage political advice."

Edgar Allan Poe's 'Some Words with a Mummy' (1845): A mummy, brought back to life by an electrical current, falls over and angrily contrasts the superiority of ancient Egypt with the USA.

Origin and "Mummy Mania":

Tales of reanimated mummies likely stemmed from the popular mummy unwrapping events conducted by figures like Thomas Pettigrew.

Albert Smith's Mr Grubbe's Night with Memnon (1843): An example of "Mummy mania" where the protagonist, locked in the British Museum after an unwrapping, wakes to find the mummies and other Ancient Egyptian artefacts alive, dancing, and drinking punch.

Romance and Horror:

Théophile Gautier's Le Pied de momie or The Mummy’s Foot (1840): Features the earliest instance of Victorians falling in love with mummies, though the main character is rebuffed due to the immense age difference.

By the mid-century, mummy stories shifted toward horror, often driven by women writers, such as Louisa May Alcott's Lost in a Pyramid (1869) and Jane Godwin Austin's After Three Thousand Years (1868).

Late Century Curse and Horror:

H. Rider Haggard’s Cleopatra (1889): Cleopatra steals the gems of Menkau-ra, triggering a curse that leads to the death of her servant and a reimagining of Cleopatra's own death as the mummy's curse.

Arthur Conan Doyle wrote two mummy stories: The Ring of Thoth (1890), about an immortal mummy seeking death to be reunited with his love, and Lot No. 249 (later La Momie vivante).

Bram Stoker’s The Jewel of the Seven Stars: Features the destructive Queen Tera, whose unwrapped body is found to be the doppelgänger of the Egyptologist who brought her to the UK.

👻 The Mummy's Curse: A Study in Rumour (Luckhurst, 2010)
This text examines how rumours fueled the pervasive idea of the mummy's curse, particularly following the discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb.

Tutankhamun's Tomb and the Curse (1923):

The death of Lord Carnarvon in April 1923 was swiftly attributed to a curse by novelist Marie Corelli and Arthur Conan Doyle (who was promoting spiritualism).

Novelist and Daily Express correspondent Arthur Weigall amplified the idea in his essay, The Malevolence of Ancient Egyptian Spirits, by recounting personal "creepy stories."

Author Rider Haggard suggested reburning Tutankhamun to prevent ill effects on tourists.

The Power of Rumour:

"Spooky stories" spread centrally through rumour, which gained authority even from its own refutation.

Two curses were reported in the tomb: one on a clay tablet in the anti-chamber ("Death shall come on swift wings...") and another on the entrance ("Death to those who entre").

29 deaths were eventually linked to the tomb, including American robber-baron George Jay Gould, Carnarvon's half-brother Aubrey Herbert, and Governor-General Sir Lee Stack.

When curse-denier Arthur Weigall died in 1934, newspapers ran contradictory headlines: 'Arthur Weigall, who denied Tutankhamen's Cruse, is Dead' followed by 'A Curse Killed Aurthur Weigall'.

The "Unlucky Mummy" (Thomas Douglas Murry):

The case of the mummy Murry donated to the British Museum was reported in the press as early as 1904 (by Bertram Fletcher Robinson, who later died young).

This mummy was supposedly purchased by Murry in 1864; he was said to have suffered personal misfortunes (lost arm, loss of porters/party members) and others, including Mrs Warwick Hunt (to whom it was given), also suffered.

The mummy was linked to the sinking of the Titanic in 1912. Spiritualist editor W.T. Stead, who perished on the ship, had reportedly discussed the case, leading reporters to assume the casket was onboard, causing the disaster.
