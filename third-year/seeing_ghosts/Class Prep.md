### Early Modern Demonic Horror (c. 1450-1750) 

In early modern Europe and colonial America, especially during the **Age of the Reformation** (c. 1520-1660), the evil source of horror was invariably the **Devil or his subordinate demons**. The main manifestations were:

- **Witchcraft:** Believed to have involved the performance of heinous deeds, including **cannibalistic infanticide**.
    
- **Demonic Possession:** Demons were believed to have invaded and taken control of human bodies, causing frightening and shocking symptoms.
    
- **Violence in Prosecutions:** The use of **torture** in witchcraft trials and the **violent treatment of demoniacs** during exorcisms were related sources of horror.

### The Image of the Devil 

- **Before 1400:** The Devil (Satan) rarely elicited fear, shock, or revulsion among Christians. He was often described in almost comical terms and was viewed as God's instrument, acting only with the **deity's permission**. His image sometimes incorporated features of pagan fertility gods like the Greek god **Pan** or the Celtic god **Cernunnos**.
    
- **After 1400/Reformation Era:** The Devil's image transformed, becoming more repugnant and eliciting fear, shock, and revulsion.
    
    - Images became more grotesque, sometimes including a **second face in the lower regions** and displaying the **talons of a predatory bird**.
        
    - The biblical warning that the Devil "prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking some one to devour" (1 Peter 5:8) made him a more horrifying figure.
        
    - Prophecies in Revelation led to the widespread belief that the Devil was especially active before the **Second Coming of Christ**.

### The Witches' Sabbath 

- Described as the **"ultimate horror show"** in early modern Europe.
    
- This imaginary assembly was constructed to depict witches as perpetrators of the **worst possible crimes**.
    
- The charges alleged under examination included:
    
    - Making **face-to-face pacts with the Evil One**, making them guilty of **apostasy and heresy**.
        
    - Worshipping the Devil and engaging in activities that **reversed all moral norms**.
        
    - The **sacrifice and consumption of unbaptized infants** (cannibalistic infanticide). In 1609, witches in the Basque region confessed to "killing children and exhuming and devouring the corpses of witches and unbaptized children".
        
    - Using **exhumed corpses** and aborted fetuses in magical arts.
        
    - **Promiscuous and incestuous sexual intercourse** with other witches and demons.
        
    - Attending a **parody of the Christian communion service** (black mass).
        
- The descriptions of the Sabbath, often confessed to under torture, nurtured the fear that the Devil was determined to destroy Christianity and the social, political, and moral order.

### Demonic Possession 

- Based on the belief that demons could **enter the bodies of human beings** against their will and take control of their faculties.
    
- **Symptoms displayed by demoniacs:**
    
    - Violent convulsions, abnormal swelling, muscular contortions, and **preternatural strength**.
        
    - Vomiting of extraneous substances.
        
    - Conversing in unknown languages and speaking in deep, beastly voices.
        
    - Displaying contempt for sacred objects and uttering **blasphemies**.
        
    - In a few cases, **levitation** was reported.
        
- **Horror:** Arose from witnessing the demoniacs' pathological symptoms, the transformation of their personalities, and the blasphemies spewed from the mouths of otherwise pious individuals.
    
- Possession was **more credible** than the Witches' Sabbath, reaching a wider audience and witnessed by large crowds, thereby amplifying its horror.

### Horror vs. Terror 

- **Horror:** An emotion experienced mainly by **observers** (readers, witnesses, audiences). The intensity depends on the grotesqueness and the **credibility** of the representation.
    
- **Terror:** The fear, often deliberately instigated, among **victims or potential victims** of grievous physical or emotional harm.
    
- **Intersection:** When those who are horrified fear that **they too might become victims**. Witches were believed to be **terrorists** who instilled terror in their victims and created horror among those who read accounts or saw images of their alleged deeds.

### Modern Revival (Late 20th/21st Centuries) 

In the late 20th century, witchcraft and possession regained their ability to horrify.

#### 1. Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA)

- A wave of accusations that child molesters were engaging in bizarre satanic rituals in childcare facilities in the US and UK. These allegations closely resembled early modern witchcraft charges.
    
- Charges included: **worship of the Devil**, sexual molestation of children, mutilation of humans and animals, **murder of children**, drinking human blood, and **cannibalism**.
    
- The horror matched or even exceeded the horrors of the Witches' Sabbath.
    
- The craze ended when lawyers discredited the testimony, similar to the Spanish inquisitor Alonso de Salazar Frías in the early 17th century.
    

#### 2. Modern Possession Cases

- A notable increase in reported cases and exorcisms coincided with the revival of belief in the Devil.
    
- This increase was fueled by popular culture, such as _The Exorcist_ (1971 novel/1973 film), and the Roman Catholic Church's publication of a new exorcism ritual in 1999.
    
- **Pentecostals (Charismatics)**, who believe in both divine and demonic possession, have experienced some of the most horrifying cases, focusing on the sins of the demoniac and the horrors of damnation.
    
- Possession and exorcism are considered intrinsically **theatrical** , with participants following "scripts" that are ultimately **horror shows**.



## Demonic horror types 
- **The Horror of Satanic Worship:** Shock and disgust at images of child sacrifice, cannibalism, sexual abuse, and rampant immorality.
    
- **The Horror of Demonic Possession:** Frightened and shocked eyewitnesses, and **terror** in those who feared being the next victims.
    
- **The Horror of Torture and Violence against Witches and Demoniacs:** The most powerful, eliciting equally appalling reactions from believers and non-believers alike.



# Owen Davies The Haunted 

### Imitating the Dead: Fraudulent Manifestations

The success of ghost hoaxes relied on the **familiarity** of spectral manifestations in the prevailing oral and literary culture, which allowed perpetrators to conform to audience expectations.

#### 1. Reformation Propaganda and Clerical Deception

Anti-Catholic propaganda frequently accused Catholic clergy of mimicking spirits for personal gain and recreation.

- **Accusations:** Protestant writers like **John Bale** and **Samuel Harsnett** denounced Catholic priests for using "tricks and necromancy" to simulate supernatural phenomena, such as making vaults sound or houses clatter with chains.
    
- **Alleged Methods:** These included placing accomplices in **vaults** beneath tombs to speak as the dead , or using a "gastly ghost, walking in a sheet" to secure conversion. One instance described a priest placing **candles on crabs** to simulate purgatorial souls hovering over graves.
    
- **Conclusion:** Accusations of Catholic deception **far outweighed** concrete evidence of such practices.
    

#### 2. Visual Simulation: The White Sheet

The simplest and most common method to simulate a ghost was to wear a **white sheet**.

- **Early Accounts:** Reginald Scot noted that "one knave in a white sheet hath cozened and abused many thousands". **Erasmus** described a detailed hoax involving a sheet and a **live coal in a shell** to convince a priest that a ghost was burning.
    
- **Urban Pranks:** These hoaxes were common in public spaces like streets and churchyards. Perpetrators were caught near **Westminster Abbey** and **St Paul's churchyard**, often using white fabric and chalk to enhance the effect.
    
- **Consequences:** Hoaxers frequently faced legal penalties or physical retribution, with one perpetrator being **beaten so severely** by a posse he required hospital treatment.
    

#### 3. Auditory and Poltergeist Hoaxes

In confined or domestic settings, mimicking **auditory phenomena** was often the preferred method, as it did not require a visual apparition.

- **Vocal Simulation:** Techniques included placing a long **hollow reed or cane** through a wall to speak into, mimicking a dead person's voice, sometimes for fraudulent purposes such as acquiring an inheritance.
    
- **Poltergeist Activity:** Simple subterfuges included a boy violently **jumping on a central beam** to shake a house , or a girl tying a **strand of her hair** to objects to simulate invisible movement.
    
- **Stone-Throwing** was a "satisfying and relatively easy" manifestation to emulate, often leading to rumors of haunting.
    

#### 4. The Role of Servants and Gender

A distinction existed between the gender of hoaxers and the type of haunting simulated.

- **Gender Distribution:** **Sheet-wearing** was typically a **male** activity in public spaces. **Poltergeist activity** was largely perpetrated by **young females**, particularly **servants** who were constrained to the domestic environment.
    
- **Motivation:** Servant girls used hoaxes to transform the supernatural into **domestic power**. Motives included mischief and attention-seeking, with one girl confessing she caused disturbances because she was **frightened of being left alone** and wanted the attention to keep the family at home. This use of the supernatural to manipulate household dynamics aligns with patterns observed in adolescent possession cases.
    

#### 5. Criminal and Financial Exploitation

Ghost simulation was frequently employed for criminal or financial gain.

- **Theft and Extortion:** Thieves used the sheet disguise to frighten households and steal goods. Other criminals, such as Arthur Chambers, hid in a coffin and emerged as a ghost to facilitate a robbery. Extortioners used "delusory shewes and apparitions" to coerce victims into giving up their inheritance.
    
- **Diversion:** Smugglers and poachers employed ghost illusions, such as **blue lights** or a man with a **speaking trumpet**, to frighten people off the streets and clear areas for their illicit activities.
    
- **Housing Market:** Hoaxes were instigated to "sink the Rents of a House" or to prevent new tenants from being enticed.

### Projecting Ghosts: Technology and Illusion

The history of ghost projection details the shift from simple costume hoaxes to sophisticated optical illusions and media production.

#### 1. Early Optical Illusions

The quest to create a visible yet intangible ghost led to early scientific exploitation of optics.

- **Mirrors:** As early as the 1530s, **mirrors** or "looking-glasses" were known to produce images in the air, often mistaken for spirits.
    
- **Camera Obscura:** This device used a convex lens and a darkened box to project inverted images. By the late 16th century, **Giambattista della Porta** was using it with mirrors to project correctly oriented scenes involving live actors, blurring the line between reality and delusion.
    
- **Magic Lantern:** Developed in the mid-17th century, this device provided its own light source to project images painted on **glass slides** onto a white surface.
    
    - It was primarily associated with the portrayal of **death and demons**. **Kircher** and **Huygens** (the likely inventor) were key figures in its development and dissemination.
        

#### 2. Phantasmagoria and Spectral Projection

The **Phantasmagoria** represented a significant advance, transforming the nature of projected ghosts.

- **Innovation:** It utilized **back projection** onto a translucent screen, which created the illusion of the ghost having an independent existence. Moving the lantern forward and backward created the startling effect of ghosts **lunging towards the audience** and receding.
    
- **Pioneers:** **Paul Philidor** and **Étienne-Gaspard Robertson** (inventor of the 'Fantascope') developed and popularized the show, often advertising it as an instrument of "enlightenment" to destroy superstitious belief in spirits.
    
- **Theatrical Integration:** The illusion was sometimes married with **ventriloquism** to provide synchronised speech, making the phantom appear to talk.
    

#### 3. Pepper's Ghost

This illusion combined the fluidity of real movement (from the camera obscura concept) with the translucent appearance (from the magic lantern).

- **Mechanism:** Invented by **Henry Dircks** and popularized by **Professor John Henry Pepper**. It used a large, angled **sheet of glass** on stage to reflect an illuminated actor (or ghost actor) from a hidden pit onto the performance area, creating a **three-dimensional, translucent specter** that could interact with live actors.
    
- **Impact:** Pepper's Ghost was a theatrical sensation and was used by travelling **"Ghost showmen"** at fairs for several decades.
    

#### 4. Ghosts in Early Cinema and Photography

The development of photography and motion pictures introduced new methods for spectral representation.

- **Spirit Photography:** Began in the 1860s, driven by the desire for **physical proof of the spirit world**. Early ghost photographs were often the result of long exposure times, where a moving person appeared as a translucent figure. Fraudulent photographers were later exposed for using cutouts, dolls, and multiple exposures.
    
- **Early Motion Pictures:** Pioneers like **George Méliès** (France) and **George Albert Smith** (UK) were often former magicians or lanternists, and they applied techniques like **double-exposure** and **stop motion** to create cinematic ghosts.
    
- **Comic Genre:** Silent slapstick comedies, particularly from Hollywood studios like Hal Roach, used ghosts for farcical effect. The classic gag was the comedian mistaking someone covered in a **white substance** (like mortar or whitewash) or a white sheet for a ghost. This genre ultimately helped **rob the white sheet of its power to scare**.

### Fictional Portrayals in Drama and Literature

Fictional representations reinforced stereotypical ghostly traits and influenced how the public understood and staged hoaxes.

- **Elizabethan and Stuart Stage:** Ghosts were primarily **vengeful, bloody spirits** influenced by classical Roman tragedy (Seneca).
    
    - The ghosts often served as **dramatic interventionists**, shrieking "Revenge!".
        
    - **Theatrical Portrayal:** Ghosts typically entered from the "infernal region" via **trapdoors** below the stage , and were often dressed in **pilches** (furry leather garments) or white sheets.
        
- **Restoration to Enlightenment (18th C):** Intellectual trends favored revealing stage ghosts as **frauds or mental fantasies**.
    
    - Satirical farces, such as those by John Gay, ridiculed the earnest portrayal of ghosts, arguing a play "without a Ghost is like, is like, - igad it is like nothing".
        
    - Critics valued the psychological portrayal of fear, as epitomized by actor **David Garrick's** famous "start" upon seeing Hamlet's ghost.
        
- **The Gothic Impulse (Late 18th C):** The Gothic novel, set in medieval, Catholic, and continental environments, used ghosts as **fictional realities** to frighten and shock.
    
    - The theatrical adaptation of **Matthew Lewis's** _The Castle Spectre_ (1797) was a massive popular success due to its use of dramatic lighting and scenery to create a ghost spectacle.
        
- **Modernization:** By the mid-19th century, the ghost in **The Corsican Brothers** became the new melodramatic standard, using the innovative **Corsican trap** for a gliding, modern materialization. This shift emphasized stage spectacle and visual realism over traditional, formulaic representations.
