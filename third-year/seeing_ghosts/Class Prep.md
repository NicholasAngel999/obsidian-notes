### Early Modern Demonic Horror (c. 1450-1750) 

In early modern Europe and colonial America, especially during the **Age of the Reformation** (c. 1520-1660), the evil source of horror was invariably the **Devil or his subordinate demons**. The main manifestations were:

- **Witchcraft:** Believed to have involved the performance of heinous deeds, including **cannibalistic infanticide**.
    
- **Demonic Possession:** Demons were believed to have invaded and taken control of human bodies, causing frightening and shocking symptoms.
    
- **Violence in Prosecutions:** The use of **torture** in witchcraft trials and the **violent treatment of demoniacs** during exorcisms were related sources of horror.

### The Image of the Devil 

- **Before 1400:** The Devil (Satan) rarely elicited fear, shock, or revulsion among Christians. He was often described in almost comical terms and was viewed as God's instrument, acting only with the **deity's permission**. His image sometimes incorporated features of pagan fertility gods like the Greek god **Pan** or the Celtic god **Cernunnos**.
    
- **After 1400/Reformation Era:** The Devil's image transformed, becoming more repugnant and eliciting fear, shock, and revulsion.
    
    - Images became more grotesque, sometimes including a **second face in the lower regions** and displaying the **talons of a predatory bird**.
        
    - The biblical warning that the Devil "prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking some one to devour" (1 Peter 5:8) made him a more horrifying figure.
        
    - Prophecies in Revelation led to the widespread belief that the Devil was especially active before the **Second Coming of Christ**.

### The Witches' Sabbath 

- Described as the **"ultimate horror show"** in early modern Europe.
    
- This imaginary assembly was constructed to depict witches as perpetrators of the **worst possible crimes**.
    
- The charges alleged under examination included:
    
    - Making **face-to-face pacts with the Evil One**, making them guilty of **apostasy and heresy**.
        
    - Worshipping the Devil and engaging in activities that **reversed all moral norms**.
        
    - The **sacrifice and consumption of unbaptized infants** (cannibalistic infanticide). In 1609, witches in the Basque region confessed to "killing children and exhuming and devouring the corpses of witches and unbaptized children".
        
    - Using **exhumed corpses** and aborted fetuses in magical arts.
        
    - **Promiscuous and incestuous sexual intercourse** with other witches and demons.
        
    - Attending a **parody of the Christian communion service** (black mass).
        
- The descriptions of the Sabbath, often confessed to under torture, nurtured the fear that the Devil was determined to destroy Christianity and the social, political, and moral order.

### Demonic Possession 

- Based on the belief that demons could **enter the bodies of human beings** against their will and take control of their faculties.
    
- **Symptoms displayed by demoniacs:**
    
    - Violent convulsions, abnormal swelling, muscular contortions, and **preternatural strength**.
        
    - Vomiting of extraneous substances.
        
    - Conversing in unknown languages and speaking in deep, beastly voices.
        
    - Displaying contempt for sacred objects and uttering **blasphemies**.
        
    - In a few cases, **levitation** was reported.
        
- **Horror:** Arose from witnessing the demoniacs' pathological symptoms, the transformation of their personalities, and the blasphemies spewed from the mouths of otherwise pious individuals.
    
- Possession was **more credible** than the Witches' Sabbath, reaching a wider audience and witnessed by large crowds, thereby amplifying its horror.

### Horror vs. Terror 

- **Horror:** An emotion experienced mainly by **observers** (readers, witnesses, audiences). The intensity depends on the grotesqueness and the **credibility** of the representation.
    
- **Terror:** The fear, often deliberately instigated, among **victims or potential victims** of grievous physical or emotional harm.
    
- **Intersection:** When those who are horrified fear that **they too might become victims**. Witches were believed to be **terrorists** who instilled terror in their victims and created horror among those who read accounts or saw images of their alleged deeds.

### Modern Revival (Late 20th/21st Centuries) 

In the late 20th century, witchcraft and possession regained their ability to horrify.

#### 1. Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA)

- A wave of accusations that child molesters were engaging in bizarre satanic rituals in childcare facilities in the US and UK. These allegations closely resembled early modern witchcraft charges.
    
- Charges included: **worship of the Devil**, sexual molestation of children, mutilation of humans and animals, **murder of children**, drinking human blood, and **cannibalism**.
    
- The horror matched or even exceeded the horrors of the Witches' Sabbath.
    
- The craze ended when lawyers discredited the testimony, similar to the Spanish inquisitor Alonso de Salazar Frías in the early 17th century.
    

#### 2. Modern Possession Cases

- A notable increase in reported cases and exorcisms coincided with the revival of belief in the Devil.
    
- This increase was fueled by popular culture, such as _The Exorcist_ (1971 novel/1973 film), and the Roman Catholic Church's publication of a new exorcism ritual in 1999.
    
- **Pentecostals (Charismatics)**, who believe in both divine and demonic possession, have experienced some of the most horrifying cases, focusing on the sins of the demoniac and the horrors of damnation.
    
- Possession and exorcism are considered intrinsically **theatrical** , with participants following "scripts" that are ultimately **horror shows**.



## Demonic horror types 
- **The Horror of Satanic Worship:** Shock and disgust at images of child sacrifice, cannibalism, sexual abuse, and rampant immorality.
    
- **The Horror of Demonic Possession:** Frightened and shocked eyewitnesses, and **terror** in those who feared being the next victims.
    
- **The Horror of Torture and Violence against Witches and Demoniacs:** The most powerful, eliciting equally appalling reactions from believers and non-believers alike.
