Main thing is supporting evidence 
- holding back grade 
only a handful of quotes - this bad 
- wordage soaked up with "treading water"
- much tighter wording 

Seems somewhat colloquial
- stop writing like id speak it 

could have easily added in more evidence 

once written
highlight sentence try and cut down words used

## Signposting!!! 
stop it!

Mostly about style of writing and deploying it correctly
