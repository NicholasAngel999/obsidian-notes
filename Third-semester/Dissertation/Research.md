# Acquisition

_After the Second World War, although much of the MAPRW print library was gifted to the Italian government, a significant portion was transferred to the British School at Rome, before passing to the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford. In the early 1980s, the material was handed to Keele University in its capacity as an official Place of Deposit, where it joined the Allied Central Interpretation Unit Collection. In 2008 the collections were transferred to the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland (now Historic Environment Scotland) and became part of the new National Collection of Aerial Photography._
