Pirates were more *equatorial* than other jobs at this time

Pirates were first in society to implement checks and balances

weren't as bloodthirsty as portrayed today 
- many instead chose to have prisoners 

treasure wasn't often buried but rather on the bottom of the sea they had to dive for it 

# question
1. they are all equally unimportant articles as they are only there to be used when it best suits the user, the others can be ignored 
2. 3= honour amongst them - theyd be betting the money they won as a group and prevent in fighting 4= not to be raided 5= ready for being raided 6= no women or children because they dont think they will be able to protect the ship
