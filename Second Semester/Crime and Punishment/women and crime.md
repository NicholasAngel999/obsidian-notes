tend to commit homicide crimes in a less hands on way 

if i change this now then
### what is happening (patriarchy)

- co operating with head choppers
- she clearly isn't really stopping them 
- the men are doing the dirty work she basically just letting this happen 

### motive? why 3 individuals 
- motive? adultery 
	- inheritance 
	- down right fed up with the bitch 
	- divorce not exactly an option 

### source 2 
- displaying husbands head 
- maybe create alibi 



### source 3 historically significant 
- maybe they assumed witch shit went down because they couldn't see a woman doing it so she must be inherent evil daemon 
- cruellest punishment for evil acts 
	- makes a statement 



# source 4
she is being haunted 
- she has murdered and is now being haunted by these actions 
- all the ways she killed people 


- female violence
	- knows the victim 
	- insanity 
	- hot blooded crime?
