- In Cheshire, as in every other county and corporate borough in England, the justices met in quarter sessions in January (Epiphany), April (Easter), July (Midsummer) and October (Michaelmas), but they did not always assemble at the same place. _pg. 26._
- But in counties divided by great distances or natural barriers, in a period when roads were poor and journeys were slow, meetings in a single location imposed hardships, and were likely to deter general attendance. _pg. 26_
- While the ofﬁcers from every hundred were supposed to attend all the meetings, many justices only attended the sessions nearest their homes, and the selection of grand jurors who were mainly from the nearby settlements inevitably meant that the individual sessions concentrated on their local affairs. 48 It is interesting that this regime was amended in the eighteenth century, however, with the decay of public buildings in the lesser centres. _pg. 27_
- Criminal or interpersonal’ offences consist principally of breaches of the peace involving violence or theft, together with assaults and occasional expressions of contempt for authority. 54 The second category of ‘regulatory’ offences relates to enforcement of the statutes intended to discipline the habits of the common people in their social and economic relations. The third category, ‘obligation enforcement’ means prosecutions brought against communities or individuals in regard to their duty of maintaining highways, bridges and watercourses. _pg. 28_
- This was not a society which had abandoned spontaneous violence – the magistrates were still dealing with cases of assault in 1816– 18 – but after the middle of the eighteenth century the overwhelming majority of offences tried at quarter sessions concerned property, _pg.28 _
- Lindsey district of Lincolnshire, and there it has been explained as a shift from ‘vernacular justice’ to ‘a system of government from above’. 59 In other words, during the 1740s quarter sessions were adjudicating the people of Lindsey’s problems of petty violence, quarrel and minor theft, whereas by the 1770s the magistrates appeared to be engaged in their own campaign against what they perceived as ‘real crimes’. _pg.28_
