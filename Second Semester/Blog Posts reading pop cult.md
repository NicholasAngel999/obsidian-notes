The Middle Ages have a long record of service as a setting for romantic and heroic Hollywood films. Far from a mere fantasy space, however, Hollywood has frequently drawn on the Middle Ages — and especially medieval Britain — to articulate con-temporary political ideas and anxieties - [pg 398]

As Nickolas Haydock has argued, “movie medievalism . . . fetishizes the alterity of the Middle Ages as a temporal Other while compulsively retooling imagined continuities to fit the rapidly changing priorities of the contemporary world” [pg 398]

I would argue that medieval Britain has allowed Hollywood filmmakers to explore the values on which America was founded, particularly at moments when the relationship between the modern nation and these historical ideals has required negotiation [pg 398-399]

Fitzpatrick's monograph attempts to place the term 'neomedievalism' alongside that of 'medievalism'. In doing so she states that neomedievalism is a form of medievalism in need of re-evaluation, particularly in the ways in which the term is used in academic discourse. [216]

the monograph explores Tolkien's influence on how the public envisage the Middle Ages [216]

"Such a departure, however, fits with director Robert Zemeckis’s promise that “This has nothing to do with the Beowulf that you were forced to read in junior high school" [73]
- basically talking about how we are using romanticised views of medieval values to embed them into modern society but this film in particular is trying to break the mould and show a more true depiction of history

"The violence of the game, therefore, instils a visceral sense of risk" [228]
- Anything medieval often has the idea of being overtly violent

"typically, fantasy video games attempt to instil in the player a sense of empowerment" [228]
- possibly the idea that you had to rise through ranks ??????

"the game will never let you stop being vulnerable" [228] 
- very medieval



## ‘No Mastery without Mystery: Dark Souls and the Ludic Sublime’, _Game Studies_, 15.1 (2015)

“Dark Souls sets out with the express purpose of unsettling these preconceptions, deploying a range of formal techniques and mechanisms designed to arrest the player’s judgment and prevent her from arriving at a stable cosmic understanding, preserving a sense of mystery and gesturing towards a whole that escapes the player’s conceptualizing grasp.”

you can argue that _Dark Souls_ uses its game design to deconstruct traditional chivalric ideals, presenting a world where:

- **Honor is ambiguous**: Actions lack clear moral outcomes.
    
- **Heroism is questioned**: Success often comes through trial and error, not noble deeds.
    
- **Identity is fragmented**: Players encounter multiple versions of themselves, challenging the notion of a singular, heroic self.
    

By integrating Vella's analysis demonstrate how _Dark Souls_ serves as a modern commentary on the complexities and contradictions of medieval chivalry in contemporary popular culture.
