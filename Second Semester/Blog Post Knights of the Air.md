"The myth of the flying ace emerged during world war 1 [...] originally born as a propaganda figure"


"The myth and propaganda surrounding these men reflected knightly virtues of chivalry and honour and harkened back to a nostalgic view of warfare that stood in stark contrast to the realities of modern warfare technologies."


"Top Gun: Maverick makes the case for the human factor in air warfare: technology may change, but a machine can never replace a human being, never mind a flying ace"


"The role of the individual knight of the air is cemented by the film's narrative: Maverick stands apart as an independent and iconoclastic warrior outside the traditionally hierarchical military structure — a true Maverick as his name implies. Via the myth of the flying ace, Top Gun: Maverick celebrates values such as comradeship, the family of choice, honour, and chivalry."


"Caused by a combination of heavy firepower on both sides and a lack of rapid mobility and logistics, in conjunction with the onset of winter, massive casualties led to the front lines freezing in place. This was not the war of individual glory, European chivalry, and noble patriotism that had been imagined in prior decades. Neither human bravery nor élan or the spirit of the offensive could counter modern industrial warfare"


"The pilot-hero was made unique by a whole mythology of speed as an experience, of space devoured, of intoxicating motion"

"Warfare can now be delegated to the modern day knights who have exchanged their gleaming helmets and plumes for polycomposite versions with Star Wars-style black visors. That their steeds are now multi-million pound (or more often dollar) aircraft is at the heart of the public perceptions of the use of air power in modern warfare. But these perceptions are almost totally western orientated. It is unlikely that the Serbs would see modern air power in such a rosy,soft-focus light." [pg 1]


"But these casualties were on a different scale to trench warfare and the emerging perception was that a fleet of self-defending bombers would be able to take the battle direct to the enemy’s homeland with impunity." [pg 2]


"Trenchard endorsed the importance of targeting ‘morale’ by stating that it outweighed the physical by a factor of 20:1." [pg 2]

 
"Air power had played a vital role in many areas from,
ironically, the defence of the UK during the Battle of
Britain to the Bomber campaign. But it could not claim
to have done it alone" [pg 3]

"the pilots who took to the skies were quickly transformed into heroic and legendary
figures" [205]


"combat aviation contrasted with the public's disdain and apathy toward the brutality of trench warfare." [205]


"the popular desire to crown aviators as a new knighthood led to the growth of legends, often at the expense of truth and historical accuracy" [205]


"number of American pilots served with the French and British forces with distinction in their roles as fighter pilots, and many became "aces" with five or more aerial victories. The American forces did not even arrive in France until early 1918, and they did not make their first combat flights until April of 1918" [205]


"In this case, myths and legends are seen as a way to "sell" the idea of airpower to the military establishment and the public." [206]
