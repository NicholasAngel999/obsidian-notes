"The myth of the flying ace emerged during world war 1 [...] originally born as a propaganda figure"


"The myth and propaganda surrounding these men reflected knightly virtues of chivalry and honour and harkened back to a nostalgic view of warfare that stood in stark contrast to the realities of modern warfare technologies."


"Top Gun: Maverick makes the case for the human factor in air warfare: technology may change, but a machine can never replace a human being, never mind a flying ace"


"The role of the individual knight of the air is cemented by the film's narrative: Maverick stands apart as an independent and iconoclastic warrior outside the traditionally hierarchical military structure — a true Maverick as his name implies. Via the myth of the flying ace, Top Gun: Maverick celebrates values such as comradeship, the family of choice, honour, and chivalry."


"Caused by a combination of heavy firepower on both sides and a lack of rapid mobility and logistics, in conjunction with the onset of winter, massive casualties led to the front lines freezing in place. This was not the war of individual glory, European chivalry, and noble patriotism that had been imagined in prior decades. Neither human bravery nor élan or the spirit of the offensive could counter modern industrial warfare"


"The pilot-hero was made unique by a whole mythology of speed as an experience, of space devoured, of intoxicating motion"
