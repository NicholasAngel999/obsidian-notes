### Prisoner - Fuller

Q. Did you ever swear this fact to any other person but the Prisoner at the bar?

Bailey. To no other person in any way, I never was the man that offered any such thing.

[Prisoner. There was another person committed on the oath of Francis Bailey .]

Bailey. It was not done by me

[Prisoner. I never did any harm to him in my life]

### Richard Akerman

Q. Do you know where the Prisoner was the 24th of February?

Bowry. I know nothing of that.

[Richard Akerman . I am clerk of the papers under Mr. Akerman the keeper; this is a true copy of the warrant by which Thomas Bowry was committed to Newgate]

Q. Does Mr. Ashby act as a justice of the peace for the county of Middlesex?

[Richard Akerman . I believe he does.]
### George Cook

Bowry. To the best of my knowledge I did not.

[George Cooke , Esq; sworn.]

Q. Do you know any thing of the account Bailey gave of this immediately after it had happened?

[George Cooke , Esq; This made a great noise in the country, and a gentleman, (I think it was a surgeon), came and told me he believed Bailey could not live till next morning, and desired as I was in the commission of the peace that I would go and take what evidence he was capable of giving. I went to him, and asked him as to the circumstances of the fact, and he said much the same as he has said now; I asked him who it was that did it. He said, he did not care to say who it was. I asked him whether it was Bowry: He said it was not him, as he said with respect to two or three other names that I mentioned. I asked him whether he would swear to any thing; he did not care to do it (he was in a very weak condition) but he said, if he lived to come abroad again, and was to see the man, he should know him as well as any man in England; I believe he was a little conscientious, as he thought himself a dying man, and so did not care to swear to any body. [The Prisoner desired some witnesses might be called to his character.]]

Joseph Judge . I know the Prisoner to be an honest pains taking man, and one that takes care of his family - I knew him when he sucked at his mother's breasts, and I take him to be a very honest worthy man.

Jury. Are you any relation to him?

Judge. I married his mother's sister's daughter.

Jury. We should be glad to know when he absconded where he went, and to have some account of his behaviour during that time.

Judge. I did not know where he was.

Francis Bowry . He is a good honest man, he serves the Bricklayers, and works hard for his living and to maintain his family.

Jury. We beg Mr. Cooke will be so kind as to speak to the character both of the Prosecutor and the Prisoner.

[George Cooke , Esq; As to the character of the Prosecutor, I don't think the man would take a false oath upon any account in the world. (I have lived all my life in the parish, and he always bore an extraordinary good character.) I have very good reason to believe so, because he was so cautious (when I was with him) what he said.]

Q. What is the character of the Prisoner?

[George Cooke , Esq; I don't know whether it may be so proper in a Justice of Peace, as 'tis a case of life and death, to say any thing, and therefore I desire to be excused.]

# The case
### charges 
charged under the black act 1723 
- shot at Francis Bailey with a gun loaded with gun powder and small stones 
- Assaulting Francis with the intent to rob him

# details 
Feb 24th 1742 Francis Bailey returned from Uxbridge market to Harefield. He saw a man he later identified as Robert Fuller sitting on a stile with a gun. Robert grabbed Baileys horse's bridle and demanded money. Bailey refused and Fuller fired at him. The shot hit baileys right arm shattering the bone causing Bailey to suffer through recovery for 20 weeks. 
### identify
Bailey knew Fuller's father and so could identify Fuller. the attack took place on a clear night allowing Bailey to see Fuller's face. Thomas Bowry was initially accused of the crime and imprisoned for 17 weeks based on an affidavit stating that Bailey was too ill to testify. Bailey insisted he never accused Bowry. The Justice George Cook confirmed for the court that Bailey was initially too weak to formally identify the attacker but later swore it was Fuller. Fuller had apparently disappeared for the next year before being arrested at his home on Feb 27 1743. Witnesses gave mixed accounts of his whereabouts during the attack. Fuller was then found guilty of both shooting and attempted robbery and sentenced to death. The jury recommended mercy due to the confusion over Bowrys earlier wrongful imprisonment.
