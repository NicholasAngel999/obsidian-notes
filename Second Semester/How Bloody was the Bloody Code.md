"During the long eighteenth century the capital code, and
specifically the so-called 'Bloody Code', which subjected
and increasing range of property crimes to the death penalty was the centre of much popular attention and of extensive debate" [p.159]

"The impact of the Bloody Code has also attracted much attention from historians, some of whom have argued that it played a vital role both within the criminal law and in eighteenth-century social relations more generally" [p.159-160]

"Jones's brief article 'Life and Death in Eighteenth-Century Wales' have tentatively suggested that Welsh capital convicts received 'more favourable punishment', but this work has been largely ignored by those investigating capital punishment in eighteenth-century England" [p.160]

"It was not long before commentators were reflecting upon the horrific nature of the unreformed criminal law. In 1857, Charles Phillips commented that it was ‘frightful to look back on the penal code of England, as it stood even in our own day. Every page of our statute book smelt of blood" [683-684]


"The label of the ‘bloody code’ has survived to define the whole era of criminal justice in the long eighteenth century." [684]


"It is only recently that this view has been revised and historians have emphasised the need for a more textured reading of the eighteenth-century criminal law that attends to the histories of individual offences" [684]


"It was in the preceding years that reformers established the image of the law as a ‘bloody code’, dangerously out of touch with the people it was supposed to protect" [684]


"It argues that the scandal surrounding the crime of forgery was vital to the reformers’ success." [684]


"Forgery became the focal point for opposition to the death penalty following a crisis in forged Bank of England notes in the period 1818–21 and a series of scandalous cases in the 1820s." [684]


"By 1830, reformers were in a position to persuade the Commons that opinion had shifted irrevocably against the punishment of death. As they did so, they suggested new ways of understanding the relationship between law and society." [684]

"The history of punishment in the years between 1660 and 1914 can too easily be viewed as a simple journey of progression, from the brutality of the gallows to the relative calm and ordered world of the penitentiary" [275]


"Nicola Lacey reached the conclusion that legal (i.e. state) punishment is the principled infliction by a state-constituted institution of what are generally regarded as unpleasant consequences upon individuals or groups adjudicated [. . .] to have breached the law.1" [275]


"However, punishment can also be viewed as a form of retribution, a means for society to ‘avenge’ itself on the criminal on behalf of the victim of crime. Modern debates about, for example, the restitution of the death penalty, or the quality of prisoners’ lives, often turn around questions of justification and intention." [276]


"The ancient, biblical principle of ‘an eye for an eye’2 informed early punishment, but its impracticality is evident. If ‘someone kills they are killed’ makes a crude sort of sense but if a man steals my car am I supposed to steal his?" [276]


"According to Durkheim, punishment, as well as being a tool to control crime, is a means for the governing authority to demonstrate that they are in charge" [276]


"The seemingly indiscriminate use of the death penalty in the period between the late 1680s and the early 1830s has come to be seen as the defining characteristic of the Hanoverian criminal justice system" [281]


"From 1689 onwards, as parliament sat more regularly it was able to pass more laws – laws that frequently had very specific and localized intentions. These were laws that protected the property of those with influence within parliament, the small numbers of men that were entitled to vote and their representatives." [281]


"Thus, an act in 1753 made the theft of shipwrecked goods punishable by death, one in 1764 prescribed death for those stealing or destroying linen, another in 1769 made the act of destroying a mill a capital offence, and perhaps most significant of all, new legislation protected the new paper currency that was symbolic of England’s burgeoning commercial expansion." [281]


"In all the capital code expanded from 50 to over 200 separate statutes that decreed the death penalty for those that broke them. In reality most of those executed continued to be condemned under legislation enacted in the medieval and early modern periods." [281]


"In addition, there were a host of related offences that also prescribed the death sentence. Ostensibly the act was aimed at preventing poaching and attacks on gamekeepers around Waltham in Hampshire but has come to be seen as an example of the Hanoverian regime’s brutal repression of the labouring class." [282]


"This meant that individuals could be tried before judges and juries where they might be less likely to benefit from the sympathies of locals. For example, smugglers and those accused of attacks on the revenue men who policed the illegal trade in alcohol and tobacco along the southern coast were often acquitted by sympathetic juries who either approved of their actions or had been bribed or coerced into so doing.24 By moving offenders to assizes in ‘neutral’ areas, and allowing more time to bring cases to trial, prosecutions were more likely to succeed [282]


"The Black Act, therefore, needs to be seen as a draconian piece of legislation that undermined some of the basic principles of the English criminal justice system. [282]

A reluctance to execute too many convicts and concerns that the death penalty failed to deter crime led to the development, from the late seventeenth century, of the secondary punishments of transportation and imprisonment,3 while for a variety of reasons victims and witnesses of serious crime (felonies) frequently failed to prosecute, despite their legal obligations. Instead, they chose informal methods for dealing with the culprit (or simply ignored the crime). [97]


 The rewards which stimulated so many capital convictions came to be labelled as 'blood money', and they added to growing doubts about the use of the 'bloody code' [98]
 - _by this we mean rewards from statutory rewards which stopped in 1818_

By the end of the eighteenth century reformers called for a centralised police force and the creation of public prosecutors, further steps in the evolution of a system in which the state, not the victim, would eventually acquire the power to determine which criminals would be prosecuted [98]
- _this could be argument for not so bloody code. they were making steps towards a less bloody code_

Concurrently, parliament began to meet regularly, allowing more legislation to be passed in response to pressing concerns. As well as offering rewards for the conviction of criminals, parliamentary statutes created new capital offences (adding to the bloody code) to deter potential offenders and revised and introduced new secondary punishments [98]

Between 1688 and 1820, the number of capital crimes in England and Wales increased exponentially from 50 to over 220.

“there is probably no other country in the world in which so many and so great a variety of human actions are punishable with loss of life as in England.”
- _sir Samuel Romilly told the house of commons in 1810_

“… frightful to look back on the penal code of England, as it stood even in our own day. Every page of our statute-book smelt of blood.”
- _Charles Phillips described with horror 1857_

the majority of those convicted of lesser offences were often pardoned, receiving instead a sentence of transportation or even imprisonment. Indeed, it was estimated in the 1820s that in order to hang all those condemned to death, four persons would have to be dispatched on the gallows every day of the year with the exception of Sundays

The 1970s and 1980s witnessed a debate among Marxist historians and others over the extent to which the Bloody Code operated as a tool of the ruling elite to protect property interests
