Kaueper chapter: 
 

Some of the issues in understanding when and how chivalry started is that it is unclear if royal authority during and in the immediate aftermath of the Carolingian Empire was capable of creating an army on ‘universal male service’ and it is also unclear if the Carolingian Empire was ruled by a series of local warlords or if it was a Roman 'fantasy’ re-restoration (p64) 
Cavalry were dominant in combat, but the extent to which this dominance relates to chivalry is questionable or else you'd be able to date percicely the origins of chivalry (p65) 
Without technological invocations such as the stirrup popular images of knights would vanish as it would not have allowed for mounted men in armour with large lances and shields to exist on the battlefield (p68) 
The stirrup was gradually realised by European armies for its potential and only really used by all armies in Europe by the mid-late 11th century. At the Battle of Hastings it can even be seen that Norman cavalry were not using the technology to its fullest as they had javelins designed to be thrown rather than lances to be crushed into the enemy (this is a generalization). If the popular image of the knight is to be taken into account, this would suggest that medieval chivalry came into being in the late 11th century rather than at the end of Carolingian power (pp 67-68) 
Of the knights/ proto-aristocrats who existed there was not one civilian and all were effectively a 'military cast’ (pp68-69) 
The empire of Charlemagne only expected those of ’a certain landed status’ to go on into military service (p69) 
Early aristocratic fighters deliberately distanced themselves from other fighters by adopting titles that suggested their innate stature as better fighters and superior such as ‘Lord’. They would not have called themselves ‘milities’ or ‘miles’ which was the term that would eventually be used to describe a knight (p71) 
The miles were as a group were what mostly described knights, and their numbers could not have been made up of mostly great nobility and their sons (p71) 
The milities tended to struggle against the idea that they were part of the ‘unfree’ group who farmed the land and went to great pains to make the difference between them and those beneath them clear (p72) [likely suggesting that this was the origin of themselves or their family] 
In the ‘German Empire’, those who would be recognisable as knights were also unfree and despite having the social and economic status of knights were serfs. Despite this they held lands and wealth and some even served in the courts of great nobles (pp72-73) 
The status of knights was highly contested in some areas. William the Conqueror before the Norman Conquest even signed over knights, with one example being ‘5 knights and 1 mil’, suggesting a mix in how free these peoples actually were (pp74-75) 
In the Doomsday book the status of miles is also mixed, ranging from light cavalry to heavy cavalry with significant socioeconomic standing (pp75-76) 
In the 11th century it dosent appear that milities consisted of a single social rank or a single way of fighting (p76) 
A Chivalric ideology can be seen as emerging, however. In the Early Medieval Age, the defeated could be killed or enslaved after battle, with many attacks and wars basically boiling down to slave raids. Yet this is a distinct and sharp decline in this form of warfare amoung elite soldiers in the early age of Chivalry as they could negotiate peace and surrender and generally battles became less bloody (pp77-78) 
Killing the enemy or enslaving them became more unpopular to simply ransoming them off, although slavery was still common in Scandinavia, Scotland, and Wales (p78) 
However, death, slavery, or ransom was not limited to these areas, and were generally available options available to each commander who would do as they saw fit to their own honour code (p79) 
No matter if it were the common footman or milities there was a desperate desire to have the approval of God for combat as a sort of divine valour (pp79-80) 
By the end of the 11th century the military order was still emerging (p80) 
In Germanic society even before the Medieval era being given weapons was seen as the ascension to manhood, yet to be 'knighted’ by being given arms was a uniquely high status activity. Upon the crowning of King Charles the Bald in 888 he was given both crown and arms to note the tripple succession to manhood, king hood, and the warrior class (p81) 
By the mid-late 11th century there seems to have arise a ceremony for the accession of elite miles to a sort of warrior class, including names such as Harold Godwinson (pp81-82) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

Craig David Chivalry Chapter:  

The term chivalry has broadly become to mean the honour code of the High and Late Middle Ages with particular attraction towards tragic and heroic themes of love and courtesy, whilst leaving out the developments of heraldry and tournaments [really?] and ‘knightly orders’ (p331) 
Chaucer, as Clerk of the Kings Works, was highly invested in chivalric culture, having to organise tournaments, feats, and events alongside keeping up royal hunting lodges and the such (p332) 
Modern audiences view the chivalric knights with a warm nostalgia as honour driven warriors who held morals over all else despite any medieval knights and squires living up to these lofty ideals (p332) 
During Chaucer’s own lifetime, the English army deliberately targeted the French countryside with the aim at attacking non-combatants with the aims at drawing out the French army (p332) 
How we view chivalry is mostly a product of post-medieval commentators (p333) 
Throughout the medieval period writers offered ’complex’ and shifting views of chivalry (p333) 
All writers of the time generally agreed that knights should show the great deeds expected of them and written by later authors. However, contemporary writers disagreed on exactly what this meant. For instance was it right to bare arms in only tmournments, crusades, or in the defence of the realm? (p333) 
There was also inconsistency in chivalric models, for how could hyper masculine models of unbridled aggression coexist with chivalric ideas of restraint and civility (p333) 
What it meant to be a knight inevitably changed over three centuries, even if core ideals such such prowess, honour and nobility were constants (p334) 
Works such as those by the Majorcan knight Ramon Llull which have been described as definitive chivalry textbooks were not so at the time and were more attempts of chivalric reform and to move further from the ideals of Chaucer. Other works such as the biography of the Black Prince were romanticised and politicised accounts to encourage others such as the young King Richard II to live up to the lofty ideals of his father (p334)

# message to the lord 

Me ’lord, Earl of the March, the news to which I have received I give now unto you. Tis’ not the typical time for battle and the heavens usually show neither favour nor disdain to battle. However, the heavenly sun doth come unto thee in not one but three, a sign of the holy trinity’s blessing to thy battle and the success of thy forces. The Aquarius speaks of letting the enemy's blood spill, keeping the battle short would do us favourably. Tis' Aquarius that look upon thee upon the eve of battle, and for this the sign can only be seen as good, for our foe hath set upon a long travel for which the omens are not good. For the time is favourable for our messengers to travel swiftly. Despite the difficult time for battle during winter the trinity does side with you my lord and a swift battle would be no challenge for their holy presence. I, Alfred Fogg Ansty, beseech thee to heed the blessings of the Aquarius and the holy trinity and go into battle against the Lancastrian usurpers.
