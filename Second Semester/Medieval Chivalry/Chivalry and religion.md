	- only fight when church man says so 
## what must knights be wary of
- wary of their pride and be a sword of god not for themselves 
	- they are warriors of god 
## how does Jacques imagine the ideal relationship between the church and the nobility 
- Church shouldn't get involved with wars and things 
- have duty to tell nobility where and how to go to war
