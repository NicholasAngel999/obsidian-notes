- Pop culture tells us that medieval warfare was done by gentlemen who knew, understood and followed its rules (p163) 
- War, Jean le Bel (medieval chronicler), argues was like a game for knights, and the devastation left in their wake was a ‘regrettable consequence’ (p163) 
- The Germanic and Viking way of warfare was disappearing from European and particular ally Western war. Enemies were no longer executed after battle, slaves were no longer taken and ‘ethnic cleansing’ declined (p164) 
- Despite a decline in the terror of war, rape, pillage and plunder, murder, and ransom were so commonplace in medieval warfare they were almost casual (p165) 
- Romantic ideas of war at the time take it to be a game in which both sides competed in sports manly ways. Neither sides, apparently, was ever to take advantage of the other in a way that was unfair or broke the rules due to a knights honour being at stake. ‘playing well was key; winning was secondary’(p166) 
- Knights who were considered honourable in every way imaginable were the ones who committed the atrocities in the name of chivalry that romantics say couldn’t have happened under the chivalric code (p167) 
- In his True Chronical, Jean le Bel is ecstatic over the loot collected by knights and their allies during campaign in France (p168) 
- In many cases, winning seemed secondary to loot and hostages (p168) 
- There could be honour even in defeat so long as the battle was fought well. Such ideas were communicated between The Black Prince and Jean II after The Battle of Poitiers in 1356. Geofferi de Charny even asked the Order of the Star in his questions on chivalry when it was acceptable to flee battle (p169) 
- Chivalry didn’t prevent strategy and ambush in order to win the battle. When William of Orange was coming to the rescue of King Louis he left behind 1,000 knights in four ambush parties, and took 200 with him directly to meet the enemy (p169) 
- During the 12th century, William Marshal, seeing that the forces of House Capet had been dispersed, advised King Henry II to do the same as the French King, but to then secretly give orders to reorganize, to which the King was most responsive (pp169-170) 
- Even in tournaments there would be tactics deemed un-chivalric by modern audiences. These were praised by Marshal's biographer, and example being the actions of Count Philip of Flanders who, after stating he would not attend the tournament, rushed into battle towards the end when his opponents were sapped of energy (p170) 
- There is also evidence of bribery and assassination. In the 1396 war for the throne of Castile between King Pedro I and his half-brother Enrique de Trasámara. Enrique sent one of his knights to demand King Pedro I’s surrender as he was besieging his castile. The knight, Betrand de Gueslin, was then bribed by King Pedro to kill his employer. Once he reached Enrique, he informed him of the bribe and demanded a higher sum to not kill him, which was paid. Betrand then went to Pedro to announce Enrique’s surrender, but when Pedro entered the tent Enrique stabbed him to death and proclaimed himself King Enrique II and began the Trasámara royal dynasty (p170) 
- Wariors would often invoke the idea of fairness in battle to try to gain the upperhand but often failed. For instance, Philip VI of France tried to get the English out of Calis to fight on open ground in the name of fairness and failed. Similarly, King Edward III of England tried to cross an inconvenient river with the enemy Scottish approval, only to be told no. (p171) 
- Knights also had some concept of retaliation and holding back to prevent a retaliatory response. For instance when King Edward III took Calis after a long siege he had originally planned to force the inhabitance to pledge allegiance to him or die, to which Walter Mauny cautioned would only result in the French doing likewise (p173) 
- Despite ransoming prisoners being common, it was still common to simply kill your opponents (p173) 
- The chronicler Froissart claimed that German captors treated their prisoners poorly in order to receiver a larger ransom (p174) 
- Another example in Enrique II of Castile, who despite wanting to bring the great knight Don Martin Lopez de Cordoba into his service, vowed and eventually succeeded to kill him for killing his knights taken hostage (p174) 
- There were clear needs for rules of engagement during the chivalric period (p175) 
- One of the most important rule of war was to never break ones word, but chroniclers would often complain that even this was being broken on the regular by the late medieval period (p175) 
- The rules of engagement were not formal laws but rather an informal understanding of conduct that was often practiced, policed, and debated by knights (176) 
- The penalties for not following these informal rules could lead to being tried in a royal court, an intellectual disapproval, and ill-fame (177) 
- Gofferi de Charny insisted that a reason for defiance must first be given before warfare could commence. Justification for war was important even if there was no real reason for war (p179) 
- More pragmatic concerns such as how to win honor in war are more likely to be the reason for the formation of these rules of war than concern for goodness amongst fighters (p180) 
- How knights acted with commoners were different than how they did with each other. During the siege of Tournai under Edward III in 1340 two of his knights went out to find the French army that was attempting to cross the river in an attempt to see if they could be attacked. Upon finding the French were not crossing and not wanting to return without having done nothing they set fire to two peasant dwellings (pp180-181) 
- The case against the commoners was that they were loyal to the opposing forces and supportive of then by their taxes and the basic goods they produced (P182) 
- During the 100 years war it was not the aim of either side of limit civilian casualties. Even towards the end when a crumbling central administration in France tried to regain control over the army it was with the aim of winning more battles than limiting deaths (p184)


Medieval gens d’armes not only fought and looted; they burned villages and towns, ruined monasteries and churches, broke bridges, sank or burned shipping, and destroyed stores of harvested crops or even those standing in the fields by torching or trampling them; sometimes they destroyed vineyards by hacking vines at their roots p.186
- Invasion of Normandy in 1346 - Jean le Bel notes with some enthusiasm that he could never name all the places taken and devastated; the list would never end. Yet to provide a suitable sense of the accomplishment, he asserts that from Paris to Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue in the Cotentin, “along a front at least a day’s ride wide, that whole rich land was laid waste.”85 p.187
- (This was) scarcely limited to English invasions of Valois France. Throughout the fourteenth century (and well beyond), the Scots and English harried lands on either side of their porous border.90 Ravaging tactics were likewise common in the warfare that wracked German imperial lands over centuries. In 1179, Philip, archbishop of Cologne – to cite only one case in point – avenged wrongs done to him by Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony and Bavaria, by ravaging ducal lands, burning many fortified places and towns, and destroying churches and monasteries.91 p.188
- ...vast body of imaginative literature purveys frankly realistic representations alongside portrayals of heroes in its representations of warfare ... graphically portrayed in exaggerated language. pp.188-189
- authors of these works know the reality of war as a relentlessly and broadly destructive process in society p.189 - purpose rather to entertain
- good leader is expected to prevent such destruction in his own land, but to enact it in the lands of his enemies p.190
- All defensive wars, (Christine de Pizan) adds, are known to be just, but, as we have already noted, she warns of hellfire for wrongdoers p.191
- men-at-arms - overwhelmingly focused on the glorious exercise of prowess to secure honour and loot; any restraint basically concerned how to treat each other and how best to distribute material gains without quarrelling among themselves. p.191
- garrisons poorly paid or not paid at all simply lived off the countryside, eliminating the weakened central government as middleman; under the guise of taxation or simply by force, they extracted what modern gangs would term “protection money” from the surrounding countryside. In fact, garrisons formally charged to protect the local populace, as Craig Taylor suggests, represented the greatest threat to civilian populations in late medieval France. p.192
- Nicholas Wright: “The concerns of peasants were not only irrelevant to this matter of chivalry but the very antithesis of it: base, ignoble, unrefined, clodhopping.” p.194
- Edward III “spent a long time firing the towns, putting the French to flight, and burning their cornfields or trampling them under his horses’ feet." - Romantics cannot awkwardly claim both that the king was simply enforcing his right and that massive destruction was merely the lamentable behaviour of the sub knightly soldiery. p.197
- Sir Thomas Gray recorded that English forces sometimes ate poor rations as they were crossing regions previously ravaged by their countrymen who had carried on the war “outstandingly.” p.197

**jus ad bellum** - The right to war 
- specify principles that define one nation to engage in violent action against another 

**jus in bello** - right in war

### St Augustine
Pacificism from Christians led to fall of Rome
• The aim of war is to seek  
peace  
• But Christians shouldn’t be  
ashamed to resort to war –  
God has given them the sword  
to bring about justice  
• War can protect peace and  
punish wickedness.  
• “The wise man will wage just  
wars.

### St Thomas Aquinas 
- war must be waged on command of rightful sovereign ruler
- must be waged for just cause
	- punish evil 
- soldiers must have right intentions

What impresses people about knights Edward III sent? what you think about eye patches

- *[knights] who had each covered one eye with a piece of cloth, so that they could not see with it; and it was said that they had sworn, among the ladies of their own land, that they would never see except out of one eye, until they had done some deeds of arms in the realm of France*
	- Impressed by chivalric reasoning for eye patches and that they fought with only one eye 
	- bit dumb tho innit

what battle tactics 
- fought in night? not very chivalric or brave is it 
- burnt it not actually fighting are you

# 4.7 Letter of Frederick II to Henry II of England 

It is by Frederick II 
- King of Sicily 
- Holy Roman Emperor 
- More reliable in a sense of first hand experience 

The source is about Fredericks efforts during his crusade from Acre to Joppa to reclaim Holy land. He plans to repair and rebuild fortresses and castles in Acre [pg14]
restore Jerusalem to Christian control

The letter from Frederick II to Henry II in 1279 was about Frederick II's efforts to reclaim the Holy Land during the Ninth Crusade. In the letter, Frederick II informs Henry II about his journey from Acre to Joppa, his plans to rebuild a castle there, and his negotiations with the Sultan of Babylon to restore Jerusalem to Christian control2. Frederick II emphasizes his trust in God and the miraculous nature of the events that led to the restoration of the holy city.
