"I think it does two major things for someone listening to this sermon. (A), it conflates and links the idea of being a good Christian to the 'British race', meaning that the cause of Britain is already holy and linked to Christ. (B) in using terms such a 'Crusade' and 'Holy War' the sermon evoke ideas of the medieval period." _Gwen Miller 28th apr 2025_

## Why do you think this poster of Joan of Arc, a long-dead medieval icon from France, was used by American propagandists? Who is the target audience and why might it work on them?

she is a symbal of courage sacrifice and religious duty - all values needed in war time 
- the image of joan of arc would resoante with women - calls for womens help during the war
- 

"The image of Joan of Arc could likely be used due to France at this point in the 100 year war being on the brink of defeat until she helped turn the tide and 'Saved France'. It inspires the viewer to do the same and makes them feel like they are contributing in a meaningful way to the war effort" - _Gwen Miller 28 apr 2025_
