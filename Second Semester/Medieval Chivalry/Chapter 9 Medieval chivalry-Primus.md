Explain how the case of Lord John Fitzwalter shows some of the complexities around determining whether someone was a “good” knight (pp. 255-6)

# Chapter 8 

"began spreading terror and destruction throughout the county of  
Essex.”

"pardon for any offenses as a part of his reward for good military service"

"But he then continued his vigorous and criminal militancy at home, while also appealing to royal law when it suited his interests in protecting his own property"

"He had thwarted royal justices, would not pay taxes, and for long could never be arrested, for he threatened to break the arms and legs of any who dared try and to leave the crippled man to die"

"Many of Fitzwalter’s followers likewise obtained pardons based on past or promised war service"

These examples show someone who is not a good person but a good knight. Knighthood often included battles and proving a sense of manliness as well as a large focus on wealth and status shows in refusal to pay taxes. He was often going against the law and was in some case less than loyal making him a less chivalrous knight. His riches and willingness to fight on one hand show examples of being a good knight however his refusal to adhere to the law and defiance of the kings peace suggest he fell short of the good knight standard. This all shows the complexities with determining a good knight.

Faith and the 'model knights’  

 

- William Marshal was ‘grateful’ for the forgiveness of his sins in return for his loyal defense of the child king, King Henry III and his realm. By the time of his death he was buried under the banner of the Knights Templar holy order and was praised by clerics (p266) [suggesting that the faith and his status as a non-sinner were highly important to him, and that in turn members of the faith viewed him in high esteem] 
- For Geoffrey de Charny piety is highly important and a warrior must accept his gifts from God and fight in battle (pp266-267) 
- Before the Battle of Boonackburn he and Robert the Bruce’s army heard mass (p267) 
- Both Marshal (probably) and Charny (definitely) were crusaders, and the heart of Robert the Bruce was literally removed and brought to the Spanish Crusades (p267) 
- Marshal left gifts to religious houses and became and Knights Templar on his death bead (p267) 
- Geoffery de Charny was steeped in religious symbolism. He was a likely candidate for ownership of the Shroud of Turin and took the holy and royal French Oriflamme into battle (267) 
- Thomas Mallory's LMD’A is littered with ‘reflexive piety’, even if he never really practiced such in real life (p268) 
- There is a question about if going to war itself is something that can lead to sinning, of war could harm not just your physical body but also your soul. War made sins such as greed, lust, and gluttony much more commonplace. Further questions about sinning during crusades It was questionable if dying early was negative to your soul as it could prevent final confessions (p268) 
- On his death bed, William Marhsall is recorded to have recounted his early life in tournaments and if his service to his lord or to charity was more important. Upon deciding he lived a good life he ordered his clothes to be distributed to his family and the rest to charity (p269) 
 
 

### Why the Crusades mattered: 

 

- Going on Crusade as a knight was highly important as it demonstrated one’s piety (p278) 
- Going on Crusade was argued to be waging war on the ‘enemies of God’ (p278) 
- Crusades were not normal warfare but holy, and thus were elevated to greater importance for a knight who could see his sins whipped clean. Clerics were told to instruct knights that this form of warfare was purer than any other and even blessed directly by God (p278) 
	- [Crusades also link back to the idea of masculinity and suffering to prove one's worth]as they were longer and dangerous journeys with low and hard to maintain supply lines and disease (p278) 
- Knightly conduct differed little in the Holy Land fighting under the banner of Christ than fighting under the banner of Lords in national wars (p279) 
- Knights were said to have honored their non-Christian combatants of similar social stature [non-Christian knights] (p279) 
 

 

### Why asceticism mattered: 

 

- Asceticism ‘meshed’ well with chivalry due to the emphasis on heroic endeavor and endurance (p291) 
- Ascetic rigor was a way to gain approval from both the laity and the Church (p291) 
- It was believed that you must suffer in order to win (p292) 
- Geoffery de Charny's denunciations of the finer things in life were like that of a monk, and he believed that suffering was placed upon the knighted by god as the price for honor and glory (p293) 
	- [basically for prowess and knightly ability gifted by God, one must pay in worldly suffering] 
- Charny declares that the most righteous order of all is the knights (pp 293-294) 
- The Earl Henry of Lancaster himself wanted to suffer in imitation of Christ in order to show his piety (p294) 
- Knightly suffering is also shown to be a form on penance (p295) 
	- [likely for all the murdering] 
- Chivalry is more of a burden than it is anything else, as displayed in The History of the Holy Grail, itself an opening romance to the Lancelot-Grail cycle (p 295-296) 
 
 

### Why did work matter to knights?: 

 

- Since knighthood was given by divine will, their work was highly important (p300) 
- Physical work was an issue for knights as it bore the social stigma of being a surf or a peasant farmer. (p300) 
- Doing the work assigned to you was viewed as work given to you by God. Doing work was not punishment nor was it seen as necessarily bad but acceptance of ones position and a path to salvation (p301) 
- Knights were able to view their labor as both a penance due to how difficult it was but also a gift due to the fact that it was penance and affirming their position in the creation of God (p301) 
 

 

### Why penance and confession matters: 

- Suffering as a king or knight fit in well with a heroic status (pp302-303) 
- It was traditional that after major campaigns sins would be confessed and penanced prescribed (p303)
	- [sounds like going to the bloody GP)

# why does Kaeuper argue we need to reject both cynical and romantic readings of knightly piety 
- Romantics wont accept anything that isn't the romantic view is 
- Cynics take any small negative as a wider representation
