# Chapter 2-Models of Chivalry :

- ‘Significant’ agreement on exactly what chivalry was would be made by all knights when it came to the basics (p25)

## William Marshal

- By age 13 William was sent away to have a predominately military education (p27)
- He was knighted at age 20 in 1167 and soon went off to fight in a modest boarder skirmish. However, after battle he was asked by the Earl of Essex for a gift from his loot. Marshal hadn't gathered any loot in his enthusiasm for battle so could provide none and thus he received no honour in battle. He would rectify this mistake in later battles and use the riches this offered to climb the social ladder (p28)
- Marshal served the royal family and was protector of Henry the Young Kind (Henry II’s son) (p28)
- Marshal may have been (his biographer may have made up the accusations of romance) accused of being intimate with the wife of Henry the Young King. If he was he resolved any such accusation by demanding a dule, to which his enemies would back down (p28)
- When Henry the Young King died during Crusade, Marshal’s biographer goes to pains to assure the reader that Marshal traveled to the Holy Land to carry out Henry’s promise (p28)
- Marshal would serve Kings Henry II, Richard I- The Lionheart, and Bad King John (I), resulting in his gathering of large estates in England, Wales and Ireland (p28)
- Marshal was highly loyal, and stuck besides King John during the collapse of the Angivan Empire, the crisis of Magna Carta, and repulsed French invasion. By the time of the accession of Henry III he practically ran the govenrment (pp28-29)
- In the Historie, he writes that knights conduct sieges and battle ‘to do chivalry’ (p34)
- Marshal is recorded as saying that he would cut off a figure from his right hand critical to holding a sword and fight those who accused him of adultery with Henry the Young King’s wife to prove his innocence (p38)
- Marshal is written to have won so many tournaments and have to have won them so well that Henry the Young King would always demand him be at his side in battle (p39)
- Marshal’s biographer attacks shameful acts regularly, and even argued that the whole point of the crusades is to avenge the shame wrought unto God by the unbelievers (p41)
- His author writes about how the work of knights gives them honor and superiority (p44)
- In the civil war that followed the death of Bad King John I, Marshal fought for England as he was a knight there but encouraged his son to take the opposite side in France, thus playing both sides of the war and maintaining the family's titles. Despite this is author goes through great lengths to smooth out the incident and upon Marshal’s death he was praised by both clerics and noblemen alike (p52)
- When his great war horse had been stolen during a tournament, he and others went in search of the thief. Once they found him Marchal hit him so hard with a bat one of his eyes came out. However, Marshal decided to spare the life of the thief as he believed he had delt out enough punishment. This was meant to be a display of pious forgiveness and just vengeance (p55)

## Robert the Bruce

- In his biography, terms relating to prowess and physical skill appear plentiful to emphasize his ability (p34) He is written as having defended a ford alone, leaving 14 dead in the waters. However, Robert the Bruce would say he defended the ford with the help of God (p36)
- Robert the Bruce was likely too busy to be fighting wars in England to have been fighting tournaments (p39) [though this didn’t matter because he was fighting in war]
- He is written to be a parallel to the Maccabees in the Old Testamate and as often counseling those in the way of God (p44)
- In Barbour’s Bruce, it is written that the Scots and Robert the Bruce are trustworthy and therefore loyal individuals that abide by treaties, as compared to the English who constantly break them (p46)
- When Robert the Bruce killed sleeping English soldiers at Turybury to win the battle he wasn’t viewed as less chivalrous but that this was rather a requirement for the chivalric hero (p50)
- After his battle at the Ford, Barbour agonizes over how this may been seen as a stupid or ‘showy’ display and how a good knight must have wit as well as prowess (p53)

## Geoffery de Charny

- He was a younger son of a noble family without many great estates (p30)
- He was the leading French knight of the age (p30)
- He was viewed highly favorably by his king, Jean le Bon, being a member of his royal order of chivalry and carrying the sacred banner of the kings of France into battle (p30)
- For Charny, jousting is a way of physical combat to earn honor, but real warfare is the best way to accomplish this (p34)
- He goes to pains to describe hardship he faced upon going to war in both battle and outside of it, such as complaining about food as a display of his endurance (p37)
- Charny highly believes in physical 1-1 combat, and highlights that is should especially be done when God gives favor to you (p38)
- Argues that a knight should ‘care less about death than shame’ (p41)
- He asks French knights how they will live such a shameful old age in the knowledge that they didn’t live up to their potential in their prime (p41)
- Believes that those with great martial skills must thank God for their gifts (p44)
- A knight must by necessity, he argues, be a good Christian for death is always close at hand (p45)

- He states that to be someone viewed as loyal is important to find love, which is important as it can increase your prowess [something to fight for?] (p47)
- For him, men of great rank and men of prowess naturally are one in the same (p48)
- Charny when trying to take Calis from the English forwent chivalric ideas and bribed the man at the gate to keep it open for the French forces. Undoubtably, he imagined that once inside a great battle would commence whereupon chivalric ideals could resume but the gateman, after taking the bribe, warned the English and thus Charny lost the battle and was wounded and captured (p51)
- Charny viewed prowess as the building blocks of chivalry that needed to be baked up by wisdom (p53)

## Thomas Malory

- He was a rather brutal person. Imprisoned 8 times, he was known to have conducted cattle raids, breaking into an abbey, extortion, and rape (p32)
- He wrote the Le Morte D’Arthur, an Arthurian classic (p32)
- In LMD’A, Mallory writes about strength and physical prowess (p34)
- At one point in LMD’A, Lancelot is viewed with multiple wounds and this is why people view him as a man worthy of ‘worship’ (p35)
- He writes about honor or ‘worshype’ constantly in his books, filling the pages with examples of great knight’s physical prowess achieving them great honor (p42)
- In LMD’A, he writes Lancelot as a more human figure that can be emulated. His affair with Guinevere is deeply unchivalric and also sinful. He becomes both disloyal and a sinner in this act and it is this that prevent Lancelot from acquiring the Holy Grail. Even if the themes of love were centuries old this was seen highly negatively. However, through his later deeds Lancelot is forgiven by God, even if this act continues to stain his Chivalric appearance. Finally, Lancelot becomes a devote hermit who is later taken to heaven upon his death. It is likely that Malory wrote this Lancelot as a sort of aspiration (pp52-53)

## General:

- The core of chivalry was prowess in the pursuit of honor (p33)
- Such terms that at first seem straightforward are often the ones that fall victim to modern romanizations. For instance, ideas of piety have meant that we view knights as totally devout worshipers and prowess becomes more about ‘stoutness of heart’(p33)
- Knightly motives were proud self-assertive dominance, joyful vengeance, or acquisition of loot’ (p33)
- Knights ‘practically worshiped’ physical prowess as a way to assert dominance (p34)
- Endurance and tales of a Knight’s physical suffering are viewed as part of their deeds of honor (pp36-37)
- Honor didn’t mean someone to be looked up to as it is today, but status and precedence to be assented and defended at any cost (pp39-40)
- Knights had a form of piety and swore loyalty to God or saints. References to knights often bring up divine inspirations and will (p43)
- A knight was supposed to be loyal, but loyalty was not blind loyalty to a set of institutions, but rather a highly personal matter that demanded faith, reliability and trust (p46)
- The rules of chivalry do not escape necessity and there are times where chivalric peoples do unchivalrous things (p50)

- point with its territorial acquisitions and its administrative advances in justice and finance.2 Such processes on either side of the Channel generated what Joseph Strayer termed “the medieval origins of the modern state - ~={red} pg 241=~ 
- the goals sought by royal administrations (aided by the mass of available evidence) are relatively more straightforward on the secular side - ~={red} pg 243 =~
- Medieval kingship, as it developed, claimed clear goals: leadership in defensive and aggressive war; pre-eminence in making and enforcing – or at least supervising by way of appeals – the body of law to regulate interactions among subjects and between subjects and the crown. At home kings came to assert a role against violence perceived as a threat to public order, whatever the complications created by their own violent measures. ~={red} 243 =~ 
- Kings saw themselves as knighthood 
- In an unusually clear case, key elements of governance in the English countryside depended in no small measure on the unpaid service of “knights of the shire" ~={red} pg 243 =~
- ~={green} they talk a lot about this idea of faithfulness and loyalty=~ "The crucial concept of loyalty (as briefly noted in the case of the Marshal) is under new construction, shifting from a sense of personal reliability and faithfulness to word and obligation in general, and toward a greater emphasis on lordship and in particular the support owed the lord king." - ~={red} pg 246=~
- How the relationship between kingship and chivalry was portrayed in literature varied over time and depended upon place; it could obviously readily reflect basic political circumstances ~={red} 249=~
- It likely continued a closer link with Anglo-Saxon foundations than France did with its Carolingian past; and in England sheer capacity had been added to royal power and knightly cooperation by the Norman Conquest during a crucial era of chivalric history ~={red} 249 =~
- The defining age of classic chivalry coincided with the early formative age of the state in Western Europe ~={red} 261 =~
- The result could only be a shifting and complicated relationship between kingship and knight-hood, bringing both cooperation and conflict. Perhaps to many modern observers the responsibility of the state for securing and maintaining internal peace and for carrying out external war is simply taken for granted, thus losing sight of the centuries-long process that transformed these once novel principles into common assumptions. ~={cyan} 261=~
- men-at-arms loyally served kings without losing pride in their status as mini-kings and much-needed elite fighters ~={cyan} 262=~
- As our chronological span closes, chivalry has undoubtedly emerged to dominate the social, cultural, and military world for generations; but the early state is well on its way to broad and decisive triumph. Chivalric honor has lost none of its social luster and still shines with special radiance when reflected on armor; but kings and other governors control dispensation of its glories and prizes, controlling them like a laicized treasury of merit. ~={red} 262 =~
- With some care, we must also note that this absorption of chivalry into the mechanisms of the state did not inaugurate a reign of peace. ~={red} 263 =~
- The issue was never chivalric violence versus the nonviolence of authoritative governors. If tensions persisted, it was because behind all these transformative actions the issue of licit violence loomed. Who was to carry out licit violence? Who was to decide what violence was actually licit? Such questions in medieval society could be answered only within a religious framework. ~={red} 263=~

Medieval kingship, as it developed, claimed clear goals: leadership in defensive and aggressive war; pre-eminence in making and enforcing – or at least supervising by way of appeals – the body of law to regulate interactions among subjects and between subjects and the crown.

## Why are kings anxious to control knights
---
the case of Lord John Fitzwalter, who, with his followers, from 1342  
“began spreading terror and destruction throughout the county of  
Essex.”39 If such actions were blatantly illegal, by indenture with the  
Black Prince he served in the siege of Calais, and as so many others,  
received a pardon for any offenses as a part of his reward for good  
military service; licit violence excused illicit violence. But he then  
continued his vigorous and criminal militancy at home, while also  
appealing to royal law when it suited his interests in protecting his  
own property.40 Fitzwater was finally arrested and tried on collected  
charges that fill five long parchment membranes, front and back, in  
the record of King’s Bench from 1352. More than once his actions are  
said to have “drawn royal power to himself by nullifying the laws of  
the present lord king (attraendo sibi regale potestatem in adnullacionem  
legis domini Regis nunc regalis).”41 He had besieged the town of  
Colchester, setting ambushes that brought trade to a standstill (until  
the townsmen bought off the siege). He had thwarted royal justices,  
would not pay taxes, and for long could never be arrested, for he  
threatened to break the arms and legs of any who dared try and to  
leave the crippled man to die.
