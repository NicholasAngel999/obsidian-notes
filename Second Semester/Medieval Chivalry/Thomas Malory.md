# Thomas Malory of Hutton Conyers 
--- 
The third contender for the identity of Sir Thomas Malory, author of _Le Morte d'Arthur_, is Thomas Malory of Hutton Conyers in Yorkshire. This theory was proposed in 1966 by William Matthews in _The Ill-Framed Knight_ and later supported by Linton. Matthews' argument is based primarily on linguistic analysis, noting that the dialect in _Le Morte d'Arthur_ aligns more with northern England than Warwickshire, where the traditionally accepted Malory of Newbold Revel lived. Linguist Angus McIntosh acknowledged the dialect's northern traits but did not specifically support Matthews' claim.

A key piece of evidence is a 1468 pardon-exclusion list, which historian P. J. C. Field argues must refer to the author of _Le Morte_. While Field attributes this exclusion to Malory of Newbold Revel, Matthews and Linton contend it refers to Malory of Hutton Conyers, who had ties to the Neville family and was involved in a northern military campaign. Matthews also highlights the advanced age of the Newbold Revel candidate, making his involvement unlikely.

Criticism of the Yorkshire Malory theory mainly focused on the lack of evidence that he was a knight. However, Linton argues that he was a Knight Hospitaller, which would satisfy the requirement. If true, this would eliminate the main objection to his authorship and challenge the long-held belief that the Newbold Revel Malory wrote _Le Morte d'Arthur_.
