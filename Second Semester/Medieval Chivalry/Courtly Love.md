1. n
2. Sword fighting is really intimate 
3. too many similarities between courtly love between men and men, and men and women 

Arther and his closest friend are jousting at Camelot 
their love begins to blossom as they begin to realise the mastery each has over their massive lances
Arther has all the ladies after him but he only wants more time with that massive lance 
Gallahads arch rival lance-a-lot arrives with an even more impressive lance displaying more control over his massive weaponry 
Winning the dual Gallahad proves that whilst his lance is not as large its more about how he wields it as though its an extension of his own body, winning the dual and the love of Arther 
A lady appears, with a slightly larger lance than lance-a-lots. Impressed by its girth and length lance-a-lot falls madly for the lady leaving arther to be happy with gallahad
